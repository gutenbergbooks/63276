<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the first&mdash;concerning the orthodox Hindoo
system.</span> As inconstant fortune had torn away
the author from the shores of Persia, and made him
the associate of the believers in transmigration and
those who addressed their prayers to idols and
images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets
held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to
be considered next after those of the Parsees. It is
however necessary to premise, that among the Hindus
there are many systems of religion, and innumerable
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
creeds and ceremonies: but there is one
principal class of this people (as will be shown in
the tenth chapter), and its rank and dignity will be
brought into evidence.</p>

<p>Like Zardusht and the sages of antiquity, they
have recourse to metaphorical and enigmatical
figures of speech, as will appear evident in the
course of this narration. Long before the present
work, the author had from books ascertained their
various systems, according to a plan which he now
voluntarily abandons; as in the year of the Hejirah
1063 (A. D. 1653), whilst sojourning at Srikakul,
the capital of Kalinga,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
certain eminent persons who
were the author’s intimate friends, had travelled in
that direction for the purpose of visiting their holy
stations; one day a conference took place, on which
the author reviewed anew what he had before heard,
and with the pen of accuracy drew the line of erasure
over all that was doubtful; so that there was
found a wide difference between the first and second
work on these points.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Summary of the doctrines contained in the Budah
Mimansa.</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
The whole world is not governed by
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
the orders of a real Lord, and there is in truth no
reality in his actual existence. Whatever of good or
evil, reward or punishment, attaches to created
beings, is entirely the result of their acts, deeds, and
words; mortals are altogether captive in the trammels
of their own works, and confined in the chains
of their own deeds: without previous acts they are
liable to no consequences. The sovereign, <span class="title">Brahma</span>,
the creator of all things; the angelic <span class="title">Víshnu</span>, their
preserver; and <span class="title">Mahesh</span>, or <span class="title">Siva</span>, the destroyer of existences,
attained to this exalted eminence through
means of righteous acts and holy deeds; nay, Brahma,
through the efficacy of worship, the power of
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
obedience, the might of his religious austerities, and
by his good actions, created the world; agreeably
to the express declaration of the <span class="title">Véda</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
which according
to the belief of the Hindus is a celestial revelation,
every dignity of the celestial orders is inseparably
connected with meritorious works and holy
deeds; and as the intellectual soul is of the same
nature as the angelic essence, the possessor may, by
the exercise of angelic qualities, become one of those
exalted dignities, and during a lengthened but definite
period, be invested with power and glory. For
instance, the human spirit, which in knowledge and
good works has attained to a degree accounted
worthy of the rank of Brahma, is, on the termination
of the period of sovereignty assigned to the
present Brahma, appointed to that predestined dignity:
the same principle also applying to the other
angelic degrees.</p>

<p>This tenet therefore leads to the same inference
as the opinions entertained by the distinguished
Parsee sages, namely: that the spirits of men, on
attaining complete perfection, become united to the
heavenly bodies, and after many revolutions, the
celestial souls are blended with the divine intelligences.
According to the Mobed:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The cup-bearer poured into the goblet the wine of the celestial soul,</div>
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
  <div class="i0">And filled the nine empyreal domes with the beverage of human spirit.”</div>
</div>

<p>The world has neither beginning nor ending;
moreover all spirits are enchained in the bonds of
their own acts and deeds; so that the spirit of high
rank which adopts the practices of the inferior, cannot
attain to the sublime rank peculiarly assigned
to exalted conduct; and the inferior spirit, sedulously
given up to the works of those eminent in
dignity, is enabled to obtain that glorious pre-eminence;
so that their meritorious works confer on
them knowledge; and the purity of their intellects,
in proportion to their elevation, conducts them to
high degrees and praiseworthy deeds. The dominion
obtained by an animal body over the human
soul arises from works; as in their members, physical
structure, and senses, all men are fashioned
after one model; but through the cause of becoming
or unbecoming deeds, one is a sovereign ruler, and
another a destitute dependent. Thus, through the
influence of praiseworthy acts, one is honored and
opulent; and owing to a subservience to foul deeds,
another lives degraded and indigent; the high and
dignified agent of opulence and honor falls not into
the depths of poverty, nor does the wretched slave
to acts of covetousness and avarice ever attain the
dignity of honor and riches. The world is the root
and productive soil of works, and time is their developer;
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
because, when their time comes, it brings
the fruit, just as every season produces the flowers,
sweet-scented plants, and fruits suitable to the
period; in like manner, the result of every act, whether
deserving of praise or censure, is made to adhere
to its agent, in whatever revolution that may
be proper for it. Works are divided into two kinds:
those which are to be performed; the other, those
which are to be avoided: under the first, come
those acts, the performance of which is enjoined in
the Vedas, or the celestial revelation, such as the established
worship and the requisite acts of obedience
which prevail among the Hindoos; under the second
head come those acts, the committing of which is forbidden
by the text of the celestial code; such as shedding
blood, theft, immoral practices, and other similar
acts there enumerated. The supreme Lord stands
not in need of our adoration and obedience, nor is
he in any want of us for the performance of the
above-mentioned duties at our hands; but the results
of our acts and deeds, in reference to rewards and
punishments, accrue and adhere to us. For instance,
if the invalid should adopt habitual moderation, he
obtains that health which is the object of his wishes,
and his existence is thereby rendered happy; but
should he, from a bias to reprehensible pleasures,
the concomitants of disease, withdraw from the
restraints of abstinence, his life becomes embittered;
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
the physician, in either case, being totally independent
of the patient’s welfare and sufferings. Moreover,
the world is the abode of disease, and human
beings are the patients: if they acquit themselves in
the most perfect manner of their prescribed duties,
and strenuously avoiding what ought not to be done,
they attain the state of health, the most elevated
degree of which is liberation from this degraded
body, and union with the ambrosial sweets of paradise;
which state is called <dfn>Mukti</dfn> by this sect; and
the mode of attaining the highest degree of Mukti is
not being immersed in the pleasures of this world,
plucking away the heart from the gratifications of
sense, being content with mere necessaries, abstaining
from food, breaking the fast with viands not
relished by the vile appetite, and such like: just as
in sickness, for the sake of dissolving the morbid
matter, it becomes necessary to fast one day, and to
swallow bitter draughts.</p>

<p>Such is the substance of the tenets professed by
the sect entitled Budah-Mimansá, which coincide
exactly with those of the Yezdáníáns, except that
the latter admit the being of the self-existent God,
the sole and true object of adoration; regarding
the acts and deeds performed in this world as the
means of elevation and degradation in the next;
holding the angelic dignities to be imperishable;
and esteeming human perfection to consist in attaining
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
to the society and service of the sublime assembly
in the court of heaven; whilst the followers of
the Budah Mimansa do not admit the existence of
the eternal and infinite Lord; but according to them,
the term “Almighty” signifies the human soul, acts,
and deeds. They also assert, that the blessings of
paradise are transitory, and that the angelic dignities
are liable to perish. However, the orthodox opinion,
which is most prevalent at this time, is this:
they admit the being of the truly-existing God, by
whom the world subsists; but account his holy
essence altogether exalted, and exempt from whatever
effects created beings. They also believe that
human beings are confined by the yokes of their own
works, and enchained by their deeds, in the manner
before stated.</p>

spelling of <span class="title">Budh</span>, or <span class="title">Budah</span>, is found when the name of the legislator,
properly <span class="title">Buddha</span>, is introduced, as in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 175 of the same edition, and
elsewhere. But <span class="title">Budah</span> may also signify “past, gone,” and therefore
“prior;” on that account D. Shea rendered the above name by <span class="title">Purva</span>
(or “prior”) <span class="title">Mimansa</span>. According to Colebrooke and Mr. Wilson,
<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">मीमांसा</span> <dfn>Mímánsá</dfn>, signifies one of the philosophical systems of the
Hindús, or rather a two-fold system, the first part of which is the <span class="title">Purva
Mímánsá</span>, or <span class="title">Mímánsá</span>, simply; the second part, the <span class="title">Uttara Mímansa</span>.
“The prior Mímánsá, founded by Jaimini, teaches the art of
reasoning, with the express view of aiding in the interpretation of the
Vedas. The <dfn>Uttara</dfn>, or “latter,” commonly called the <dfn>Vedanta</dfn>, and
commonly attributed to Vyasa, deduces from the Vedas a refined
psychology, which goes to the denial of a material world.”&mdash;(<cite>Colebrooke’s
Essays.</cite>)</p>

<p class="footnote">But the above account of the Dabistán is not strictly and fully in
accordance with this definition of the first Mímánsá, because it exhibits
more of the Puranic than of the Vedáic doctrine, not without some
particular notions. It appeared therefore best to adhere to the reading
of the original text.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the second treats of certain opinions
entertained by this sect concerning the creation:
a subject which is also discussed in their puranas
or histories.</span>&mdash;In the second part of the Bhagavat,
one of their most esteemed Puránás, it is recorded
that the Almighty Creator, in the beginning, first
placed the mantle of existence on the bosom of <span class="title">Prakriti</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
or “nature,” and produced the fourteen <dfn>Bhuvanas</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
or “worlds.” The first sphere is that of the
earth, which has been estimated by some of the
ancients at five Kotes (50 millions) of Yojans,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
each
Kote being equal to one hundred Lakhs (10 millions)
and each Jojun to one Parasang and one-third;
above the terrestrial is the aqueous sphere; above
which is that of fire; beyond which is the aërial, over
the celestial; beyond which is the <dfn>Ahankar</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
or that
of “consciousness;” and higher than this is the
<dfn>Mahat-tat</dfn> (<dfn>Mahat-tatwam</dfn>)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
or “essence,” which is
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
equal to ten of those below it; and Prakrit having
enveloped it, intelligence penetrating through all
the things before said, rises above: on earth it
becomes knowledge; by means of water, there is
taste; by means of fire, form; by means of air, the
touch of cold and dry; by means of the heavens,
there is the perception of sound; and the organs of
perception, are the exterior senses; and the internal
sense is the seat of consciousness. In the same part
of the Bhagavat it is stated that, by nature, the heavens
are the vehicle of sounds; and consequently,
the nature of the air gives the perception of sound
and touch; in all other bodies the air is spirit, and
from it arises the energy of the senses. To the
nature of fire belongs the perception of sound,
touch and form; to the nature of water, that of
sound, touch, form, and savor; and to the nature
of earth, that of sound, touch, form, savor, and
odor.</p>

<p>Of the fourteen created spheres, seven rise above
the waist of the Almighty, and the remaining seven
correspond with the lower part of his body; according

“the sole of the foot.”</p>

<p>There is another division limited to three spheres:
the <dfn>Bhúlok</dfn>, “the sole of the Almighty’s foot;” the
<dfn>Bhuvarlok</dfn>, “his navel;” the <dfn>Súrlók</dfn>, “his head;” the
whole fourteen gradations in detail are thus reduced
to three, signifying a mighty personage, the same as
the Deity.</p>

<p>In the same section of that volume it is also stated,
that from the Almighty sprang <dfn>Svabhávah</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
“the
self-existing;” that is, Nature and Time; from
Nature and Time proceeded forth <dfn>Prakrit</dfn>, which
signifies <dfn>Símáí</dfn>, “universe;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
from Prakrit came
forth <dfn>Mahat-tat</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>
and from this latter, which is the
same as <dfn>Mádah</dfn>, “mental exaltation,” issued the
three <dfn>Ahankárs</dfn>, or modes of consciousness, “personality,
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
egotism,” <dfn>Satek</dfn>, <dfn>Rajas</dfn>, <dfn>Tamas</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
<dfn>Satek</dfn>,
“goodness,” means “the intellectual energy;”
<dfn>Rajas</dfn>, or passion, “the attraction of vile propensities,”
or “sensual pursuits;” and <dfn>Tamas</dfn> (darkness),
“the repelling of what repugns,” in Arabic,
<dfn>Ghazab</dfn>, or “wrath.” From <span class="title">Rajas</span> issued forth the
senses; from <span class="title">Satek</span>, the lords of nature and the servants
of the existing beings; and from <span class="title">Tamas</span> came
forth <dfn>Shaid</dfn>, “enchantment;” <dfn>Shuresh</dfn>, “confusion;”
<dfn>Rup</dfn>, “form;” <dfn>Darsan</dfn>, “sight;” and <dfn>Gandah</dfn>,
“smell;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>
that is, hearing, touch, sight, taste, and
smell; from which five were produced the heavens,
air, fire, water, and earth. Also from the three
above-mentioned properties (<dfn>gunás</dfn>) the three mighty
angels, <span class="title">Vishna</span>, <span class="title">Brahma</span>, and <span class="title">Mahísh</span>, came into the
area of the creation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
Moreover, for the purpose of
creation, eight other Brahmas were also impressed
by the first Brahma with the characters of existence,
and these became the various gradations of the spiritual,
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
corporeal, the high, the low, the mineral,
vegetable, and animal kingdoms.</p>

<p>In some of their treatises, God is the same as
time, works, and nature; whilst, according to
others, these are regarded as the instruments of his
majesty.</p>

<p>In other treatises, the Almighty is held to be light,
surpassingly great and splendid, of exceeding brilliancy
and radiance, corporeal, invested with members.</p>

<p>Other descriptions represent him as pure light,
abstract being, simple existence, unconfined by
place, exempt from transmigration, free of matter,
without parts, uncompounded, divested of the
attributes of accidents, and the creator of the
world, and all therein contained. According to other
dissertations, God is the producer of beginning and
end, exhibiting himself in the mirror of pure space,
containing the higher and lower, the heavenly and
terrestrial bodies.</p>

<p>It is stated in the first part of the Bhagavat, that
the truly-existing is an abstract being, one without
equal or opposite, who in the various languages
amongst the human race has denominations suited
to the belief of his worshippers, and that the mode
of attaining union with him depends on eradicating
wrath, extirpating bodily gratifications, and banishing
the influence of the senses. This holy essence
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
is called <span class="title">Naráyan</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
whose heads, hands, and feet
exceed all number.</p>

<p>At the period when this world and all it contains
were buried under the waters, <dfn>Tot</dfn>, or “intellect”
lay reclined in the sleep of unity, on the head of
<span class="title">Adsesh</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
the supporter of the earth. From the navel
of this exalted being appeared the lotus flower, called
by the Hindoos <span class="title">Kawal</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span>
out of which arose <span class="title">Brahma</span>,
from the members of whose mighty existence all
created beings hastened into the area of visibility.</p>

<p>It is recorded in other treatises of this sect, that
they give the name of <dfn>Naráyan</dfn>, or “the majesty
without color,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
that is, “without the qualities of
accidents,” to the absolute essence and abstract
being of God, who is in pure space. They say,
moreover, that his essence, which is devoid of all
forms, made a personage called <span class="title">Brahma</span>, who was
constituted the medium of creation, so that he
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
brought all other existences from behind the curtain
of nonentity into the luminous area of being. In
like manner that sublime essence manifested itself
in the soul of Vishnu, so that he became an <span class="title">Avatár</span>,
and to him is confided the preservation of whatever
Brahma created. That glorious essence next
called up Mahadeo, for the purpose of destroying
Brahma’s creation, whenever infinite wisdom requires
the transformation of the visible into the
invisible world; from which three agents arises the
arrangement of all things in the universe.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
They
say that <span class="title">Brahma</span> is an aged man with four heads;
<span class="title">Naráyan</span>, or <span class="title">Vishnu</span>, holds in his hand the <dfn>Chakra</dfn>,
or <dfn>Disk</dfn>, “a sort of weapon;” he always assumes
the <dfn>Avatárs</dfn>, or “incarnations;” of which ten are
greatly celebrated. <dfn>Avatár</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
means appearance or
manifestation; <dfn>Karan</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
signifies cause; Brahma,
Vishnu, and Mahadeo are called <dfn>Trikaran</dfn>, or the
three causes.</p>

<p>In the Satya-Jog there was a Rakshas<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>, named
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
<span class="title">Sámak Asur</span>, who performed such great religious
austerities, that he became enabled to work miracles;
he having taken the Anant-Ved<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>
which was in
Brahma’s possession, and from which are derived
the four Vedas given to mankind, fled into the
water; on this, Vishnu, on the fifth day of the fifth
month, <span class="time">Chét</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>
“March-April,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>
in the <span class="time">Kishn Bichah</span>,
having assumed the <dfn>Matsyávátar</dfn>, or “the form of a
fish,” plunged into the water, slew the Rakshas, and
recovered the Veda: this was the first Avatar.</p>

<p>The second was the <dfn>Kurmávátar</dfn>, or “that of the
tortoise.” <dfn>Anant Ved</dfn> signifies “the numberless
Vedas;” <dfn>Matsya</dfn>, “a fish;” <dfn>Avatár</dfn>, “descent,” or
“manifestation;” <dfn>Chét</dfn>, “the fifth solar month;”
<dfn>Kishn Bicheh</dfn>, “that portion of the month which is
without moonlight and when the nights are
dark.”</p>

<p>On the twelfth of <span class="time">Chét</span>, in the <span class="time">Kishn Bicheh</span>, he
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
assumed the <dfn>Kurmávátár</dfn>, or “that of the tortoise.”
They say that the Angels and Deeves (Asurs), taking
the serpent <span class="title">Vásukir</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
formed with him a cord, and
fastening this to a lofty mountain called <span class="place">Mandára</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
made with it a churn-staff, which they moved about
in the mighty ocean, whilst Naráyan remained
under the mountain to prevent it from falling; and
by this agitation they procured the water of life.
In the kingdom of <span class="title">Kalinga</span>, they have formed the
image of a tortoise, and among the wonderful sights
of that region is the following miraculous event: if
they cast the bones of a Brahman or a cow into the
adjacent reservoir, in the course of a year one half
of it becomes stone, and the other half remains
unchanged. It is worthy of remark, that some
Persian astronomers represent the constellation
Cancer by a tortoise, nay call it by that name, instead
of <dfn>Kharchang</dfn>, or “crab.” Ferdúsi, the sage,
thus expresses himself:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0">“The lunar lord beheld the ascendancy of the tortoise.”</div>
</div>

<p>And as they account Cancer the ascendant sign of
the world, it is therefore likely that the ancient
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
Hindú philosophers represented this constellation<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>
under the figure of the <dfn>Kurma</dfn>, or “tortoise;” also
by the <dfn>Matsya</dfn>, or “fish,” is meant the constellation
<dfn>Hút</dfn>, or “Pisces.”</p>

<p>The third was the <dfn>Baráh</dfn>, or “boar Avátar,” when
a Rakshas, named <span class="title">Karanyáksha</span>, having taken away
the earth and carried it under the water, Vishnu, on
the sixteenth of Chet in the <span class="time">Shakl Pacheh</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
or “bright
half of the moon,” assumed the form of a boar,
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
slew the demon with his tusks and brought out the
earth.</p>

<p>The fourth was the <dfn>Narsinha</dfn>, or “man-lion Avátar.”
There was a Rakshas named <span class="title">Kiranya Kashípú</span>,
whose son, <span class="title">Prahláda</span>, worshipped Vishnu, and as his
father persecuted him on that account, Vishnu, therefore,
on the fourteenth of <span class="time">Baisakh</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span>
in the <dfn>Shakl
Pacha</dfn>, or “bright half of the moon,” having assumed
the form of the Narsingh, whose head and claws
were those of a lion joined to a human body, slew
the demon Kiranya Kashipú.</p>

<p>The fifth was the <dfn>Vá-mana</dfn>, or “dwarf Avatar.”
When the Rakshas, Bali daitya, through his religious
exercises and austerities had become lord of
the three worlds, that is, of all above the earth and
below it and the heavens, so that the angels were
hard pressed and deprived of their power; Vishnu,
therefore, on the twelfth of <span class="time">Bhadun</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_45" id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span>
in the <span class="title">Shakl
Pachah</span>, descended in the <span class="title">Vámanah Avátár</span>, and coming
into the presence of Bali, requested as much of the
earth as he could traverse in three steps: to this
Bali consented, although <dfn>Sukra</dfn>, or “the planet Venus,”
the director and guardian of the demons, exhorted
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
him not to grant the request, saying: “This
is Vishnu, who will deceive thee.” Bali replied:
“If he come to me as a suitor, what can answer
my purpose better?” Vishnu, on this, included
the whole earth in one step, the heavens in the
second, and in the third, rising up to his navel,
said to Bali, “Whither can I pass?” Bali, on this,
presented his head; on which Vishnu, who saw
this, having placed his foot, sent <span class="title">Bali</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span>
below the
earth, where he has ever since continued to reign
with sovereign power, during many hundred thousands
of years. It is to be noted, that <dfn>Vá-mana</dfn>
means a dwarf, as he was a diminutive Brahman.</p>

<p><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
The sixth Avátar was <span class="title">Paras u Rama</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span>
The <dfn>Chatri</dfn>,
or “military caste,” having become evil doers, in
consequence of this, Vishnu, on the seventh of <span class="time">Bhadun</span>,
in the <dfn>Shakl pachah</dfn>, or “bright half of the moon,”
assumed the Avátar of <span class="title">Parasúram</span>, who was of the
seed of the Brahmans. In this incarnation he exterminated
the Chettri class so utterly, that he even
ripped open their females and slew the fœtus. According
to the Hindus, <span class="title">Parasuram</span> is always living;
they call him <dfn>Chirangivah</dfn>, or “long-lived.”</p>

<p>The seventh is the <span class="title">Ram Avátar</span>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span>
when the tyranny
of the Rakshas <span class="title">Rávana</span>, sovereign of the demons,
had exceeded all bounds, Vishnu, on the ninth of
Chet in the Shaklpachah, becoming incarnate in
Rama, who was of the Chettri caste, overthrew at
that time Rávána, chief of the demons of <span class="place">Lanka</span>,
(Ceylon). Now Lanka is a fort built of golden
ingots, situated in the midst of the salt ocean. He
also recovered Sita,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span>
the wife of Rama, who had
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
had been taken away by the Rokshas, which is a
name given by the Hindoos to a frightful demon.</p>

<p>The eighth was the <span class="title">Krishn Avátar</span>. When Vishnu,
in the <span class="title">Dwapar-Jog</span>, on the eighth of Bhádún, in the
Kishn pachah, having assumed the Avátar of <span class="title">Krishna</span>,
slew <span class="title">Kansá</span>. Krishna was also of the Chettri or
“military caste.”</p>

<p>The ninth was the <span class="title">Budh avatar</span>. When ten years
only of the <span class="title">Dwapar-Jog</span> remained,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
Vishnu, in order
to destroy the demons and evil genii, the causers of
night, assumed the Avátar of <span class="title">Buddha</span>, on the third
of <span class="time">Baisakh</span>, in the Shakl pacheh.</p>

<p>The tenth Avátar is to occur at the expiration of
the <span class="time">Kali-jug</span>, for the purpose of destroying the Mlechas,
or “enemies of the Hindoos.” The <span class="title">Kalki Avátar</span>
is to take place on the third of Bhádún, in the
Shakl Pachah, in the city of <span class="place">Sumbul</span>, in the house
of a Brahman named <span class="title">Jasa</span>. <span class="title">Kalki</span> is also to be of
the Brahman caste. He will destroy the corruptions
of the world, and all the Mlechas, that is,
Muhammedans, Christians, Jews, and such like,
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
are to be entirely extirpated: after which the Satyog,
or “golden age,” is to return.</p>

<p>They moreover maintain, that the contingently-existing
inhabitants and beings of earth are unable
to penetrate into the presence of the necessarily-existing
sovereign, and that the essence of the
Creator is too exalted for any created beings to
attain to an acquaintance with it, notwithstanding
the high knowledge and piety with which they may
be adorned: it therefore seemed necessary to the
Almighty God to descend from the majesty of abstractedness
and absolute existence, and exhibit
himself in the various species of angels, animals,
man, and such like, so as to enable them to attain
to some knowledge of himself. They therefore
assert, that for the purpose of satisfying the wishes
of his faithful servants, and tranquillizing their
minds, he has vouchsafed to manifest himself in this
abode, which manifestation they call an Avátar and
hold this to be no degradation to his essence.
This tenet has been thus interpreted by Shidosh,
the son of Anosh: According to the Súfís, the
first wisdom is the knowledge of God, and of the
universal soul, his life; and in this place they have
expatiated upon the attributes of the Almighty;
thus by Brahma they mean his creative power; and
by the old age of Brahma is implied his perfection:
philosophers also call the first intelligence, the intellectual
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
Adam, and the universal soul, the intellectual
Eve. The sage Sunai has said:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“The father and the mother of this gratifying world,</div>
  <div class="i0">Know, is the soul of the word,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span>
and the sublime wisdom.”</div>
</div>

<p>By Vishnu is meant his attribute of divine love,
and also the universal soul; and they give the name
of Avátar to the spirit derived from the soul of the
first heaven; in which sense they have said: “Avátars
are rays issuing from Vishnu’s essence.”</p>

<p>But these sectaries do not mean that the identical
spirit of Rám, on the dissolution of its connection
with his body, becomes attached to the body of
Krishna; for they themselves assert that Parsurám
(the sixth Avátar) is immortal, and his body everlasting.</p>

<p>When Rámachandra became incarnate, he encountered
the other; and Parsurám, having posted
himself on the road with hostile intentions, Rámachandra
said: “Thou art a Brahman and I a Chettri:
it is incumbent on me to show thee respect:”
then applying the horn of his bow to Parsurám’s
foot, he deprived him of all power. When Parsurám
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
who is now along with his wife in the heavens,
enrolled among the stars: he was the instructor of
Rama, and brought him to the knowledge of himself;
and his counsels to Ráma have been collected
by the Rishi Valmiki in the History of Ráma, called
the <cite>Ramáyana</cite>, and the name of <span class="title">Jog-Vashishta</span>, given
to them, which they call <span class="title">Indrazaharájóg Vashishta</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span>
Some parts of these tales were selected by a Brahman
of Kashmir, and afterwards translated into
Persian by <span class="person">Mulla Muhammed</span>, a Súfí. To resume:
Ráma, on hearing this expression from Parsurám,
said: “My arrow, however, errs not:” he then
discharged some arrows which have become the
janitors of paradise, and do not permit Parsurám to
enter therein. This parable proves that they are
by no means taken for Avátars of Naryáan; as, although
Pursurám and Rám were two Avátárs of
Vishnu, yet they knew not each other. Again, it
is an established maxim among philosophers, that
one soul cannot be united in one place with two
distinct bodies. Besides, it is certain that they give
the name “Avatárs of Naráyan” to the souls which
emanate from the universal soul; and that they call
Naráyan the soul of the empyreal, or the fourth heaven.
As to their assertions that Naráyan is God,
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
found himself destitute of strength, he asked
his name, and on learning that it was Ramachandra,
he was greatly astonished, and said: “Has Rámachandra’s
Avátar taken place?” and Rámachandra
having replied “Certainly,” Parsurám said:
“My blow is not mortal, I have taken away thy
understanding.” On this account it happened
that Rámachandra possessed not intelligence in his
essence, and was unacquainted with his true state,
wherefore they style him the <dfn>Mudgha</dfn>, or stupid
Avátar.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Vasishta, one of the Rishies,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span>
or “holy sages,”
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
and their acknowledging his Avátars as God, and
their saying that the Almighty has deigned to appear
under certain forms, all this means that a Naráyan
is the same with the universal soul, which the Súfees
entitle “the life of God.” As life is an attribute of
the Almighty, and the perfection of attributes constitutes
his holy essence, consequently the souls
which emanate from the universal soul, or that of
the empyreal heaven, which is the life of God, know
themselves, and acquire the ornaments of pure
faith and good works; and also, on being liberated
from body, they become identified with the universal
soul, which is Vishnu, or the life of God, agreeably
to this saying: “<cite>He who knows his own soul, knows
God</cite>:” that is, he becomes God.</p>

<p>As to their acknowledging the fish, tortoise, and
boar to be incarnations of the divinity, by this they
mean, that all beings are rays emanating from the
essence of the Almighty, and that no degradation
results to him therefrom, according to this narration
of the <span class="person">Mir Sáíd Sharif</span>, of Jarjan (Georgia).</p>

<p>As a Súfí and rhetorician were one day disputing,
the latter said: “I feel pain at the idea of a God
who manifests himself in a dog or hog:” to which
the Súfee replied: “I appeal from the God who
displays not himself in the dog.” On this, all
present exclaimed: “One of these two must be an
infidel.” A man of enlightened piety drew near,
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
and showing them the exact import of these expressions,
said: “According to the belief of the rhetorician,
the dignity of God is impaired by his manifesting
himself in the dog; he is therefore distressed
at the idea of a God thus deficient. But,
according to the Súfee, the non-appearance of
God in that animal would be a diminution of his
dignity, he therefore appeals against a God deficient
in this point: consequently, neither of them
is an infidel.” So that, in fact, the Súfís and
these sectaries entertain the same opinions.</p>

<p>The author of this work once said to Shídósh:
“We may affirm that by the fish is meant the lord,
or conservative angel, of water;” as, according
to their mythology, a demon having taken the Vedas
under that element, was pursued and slain by Vishnu,
and the Vedas brought back: thus their mention of
a fish originated from its inseparable connection
with water. By the tortoise is meant the lord, or
conservative angel, of earth; as their mythology
relates, that the Avátar of the tortoise occurred for
the purpose of the earth being supported on its back,
as is actually the case; they have also especially
mentioned the tortoise, as it is both a land and aquatic
creature, and that after water comes earth. By
the boar are meant the passions and the propagation
of living creatures; and as to the tradition of a
demon having stolen away the earth and taken it
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
under the water, and of his being pursued by Vishnu
under the form of a boar, and slain by his tusks, its
import is as follows: the demon means dissolute
manners, which destroyed the earth with the deluge
of sensuality; but on the aid of the spirit coming,
the demon of dissoluteness was overthrown by the
tusks of continence: the boar is particularly mentioned,
because its attribute is sensuality; and it was
reckoned an Avátár, because continence is virtue.
The <dfn>Narsinh</dfn>, or “man-lion,” is the lord, or conservative
angel of heroism; and as this constitutes a most
praiseworthy quality, they said, that the Narsinh
was a form with a lion’s head and a human body,
for when they spoke of impetuous bravery in a
man, they made use of the term “lion.” By <dfn>Vámana</dfn>,
or “dwarfish stature,” they meant, the lord of
reason, strength of reflection, and an intellectual
being; the dwarfish stature implying that, notwithstanding
a diminutive person, important results may
be obtained through him; as in almost a direct allusion
to this, people say: “An intelligent man of
small stature is far superior to the tall blockhead.”
By Rajah <dfn>Bali</dfn>, they typify generosity
and liberality.</p>

<p>Shidósh was delighted at this interpretation, and
said: “They have also recorded that Krishna had
sixteen thousand wives; and when one of his
friends who thought it impossible for Krishna to
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
visit all of them, said to try him: ‘Bestow on me
one of thy wives,’ Krishna answered: ‘In whatever
female’s apartment thou findest me not, she
is thine.’ His friend went into the different
apartments, but in every one of them he beheld
the god engaged in conversation with its mistress.”
This story implies, that the love of Krishna
was so rooted in their hearts, that they cared for
none besides, having his image present to their eyes,
and dwelling every moment on his beloved idea.</p>

<p>The tradition of Vishnu’s always bearing the
Chakra in his hand (a kind of military weapon),
alludes to the knowledge and decisive demonstration
which are unattainable without the aid of soul.</p>

<p>In Mahadeo, they allude to our elementary nature
by the serpent twined round his neck; they mean
anger, and the other reprehensible qualities which
result from corporeity; by his being mounted on
a bull, the animal propensities; by the tradition of
his place of repose being the site for burning the
dead, is signified, the total dispersion of the particles
of bodies and the perishable nature of things.
Mahadeo’s drinking poison is also to the same purport.
In this sense they also say that Mahadeo is
the destroyer of all worldly things; that is, elemental
nature imperatively requires the dissolution of combination
(connection), and that ultimately death
comes in the natural course.</p>

<p><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
They also hold that every angel has a wife (female
energy), of a similar generic constitution, and
originally derived from Brahma; and as we have
before stated, the philosophers call the first intelligence
the True Sire, and the universal soul, Eve;
and thus he is the head and the wife the shoulder;
the universal soul is the body of the empyreal heaven;
and in like manner the other celestial souls and
bodies have wives of the elementary nature; as they
give the appellation of wife, or energy, to whatever
is the manifest source of action.</p>

<p>Moreover the established doctrine held by these
sectaries is, that each class should worship a particular
angel, and the wife or female energy of that
angel; the worshipper regarding the object of his
adoration as God, and all others, as created beings;
for example, many believe Naráyan to be the supreme
God; several others, look up to Mahadéo, and
many to the other male and female divinities; and
thus, pursuant to the four Védas, which according
to their common belief are a celestial revelation,
they do not hold any angel who is the object of
their praise as distinct from God: by which they
mean that God, who is without equal, having
manifested himself under innumerable modes of
appearance, contemplates the glorious perfection
of his essence in the mirrors of his attributes; so
that, from the most minute atom to the solar orb,
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
his holy and divine essence is the source of all that
exists.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“To whatever quarter I directed my sight, thou appearedst there;</div>
 <div class="i0">How widely art thou multiplied, even when thy features are unseen!”</div>
</div>

<p>The Fakir Arzú says: the above interpretation
is confirmed by this tradition of the Hindus, that
<span class="title">Agasti</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span>
a star, was formerly a holy man, who once
collected all the waters in the palm of his hand, and
swallowed the whole; which means that Agasti is
the same as Sohail, a star adjacent to the south pole,
on the rising of which, all the water that has fallen
from heaven is dried up, agreeably to the Arabic
saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“<cite>When Suhail ascends, the torrents subside.</cite>”</div>
</div>

<p>Many enigmatical and figurative expressions of
a similar description occur in their writings; for
example, <span class="title">Mahésh</span> or <span class="title">Mahadeo</span>, is an angel with matted
locks and three eyes, which are the sun, moon, and
fire; he has also five heads; his necklace is formed
of a serpent, and his mantle of an elephant’s hide.
There are nine Brahmas, eleven Rudras or Mahadeos,
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
twelve suns, and ten regions, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: east, west,
south, north, zenith, <dfn>Nadir</dfn>, <dfn>Akni</dfn>, “between east
and south;” <dfn>Níreti</dfn>, “between south and west;”
<dfn>Dayab</dfn>, “between west and north;” and <dfn>Isan</dfn>,
“between north and east.” The angels are in
number thirty-three Kotes, or three hundred and
thirty millions, each Kote consisting of one hundred
Laks, or ten millions. These angels have
spiritual wives, who produce a spiritual offspring.
They likewise hold human spirits to be an effulgence
proceeding from the divine essence; if to
knowledge they add good works, with a clear perception
of themselves and of God, they return to
their original source; but should they not know
themselves and God, and yet perform praiseworthy
acts, they dwell in Paradise, where they
remain during a period of time proportioned to their
meritorious works; on the expiration of which
period they are again sent down to this lower world,
and again to receive a recompense proportioned to
their deeds.</p>

<p>The actions even of the inhabitants of Paradise
undergo an investigation, and are attended with
reward or punishments duly graduated. They also
hold that all those persons who are not sufficiently
worthy of entering into paradise, but who have
observed religious ordinances in order to obtain
dominion and worldly enjoyments, shall acquire
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
their object in a future generation. They also say,
in respect to any great personage, in whose presence
the people stand girt with the cincture of obedience,
that the rewards and results are, that this
person continues in a suppliant attitude devoted to
the service of God and those individuals who prostrate
themselves before him, are in fact humbling
themselves in adoration of the Almighty; in short,
they hold all splendor and greatness as the rewards
of alms and good works; thus they relate that whilst
the incarnation of Rámchandra abode in the desert,
he sent his brother Lachman to bring some roots of
herbs in order to break his fast; but, notwithstanding
a diligent search, he being unable to find any,
returned and represented this to Rámchand, who
replied: “The earth abounds in food and drink;
but in a former generation, on this very day, I
omitted the performance of an act which would
have been well pleasing in the sight of God,
namely, that of contributing to the sustenance of
indigent Brahmans.”</p>

<p>They moreover believe that evil-doers, after death,
become united to the bodies of lions, tigers, wolves,
dogs, swine, bears, reptiles, plants, and minerals,
in this world, and receive under these forms their
well merited punishment; but that those who have
been guilty of aggravated crimes are hurried off to
the infernal regions, where they remain suffering
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
torture during a period of time proportioned to
their evil deeds; and when they have undergone the
destined punishment, they again return to this world.
They also believe that there is in paradise a sovereign,
named Indra, and that whoever offers up a
hundred <span class="title">Aswamédas</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span>
becomes Indra. When his
appointed time in paradise, in the full enjoyment
of sovereign power has passed, he is on the expiration
of that period to descend to the lower world,
and there obtains a recompense proportioned to his
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
acts. Moreover, Indra’s spouse is named Sachí
Devi, and falls to the share of the person who
attains the rank of Indra. Note: by Aswaméda is
meant the sacrifice of a horse of a certain color, and
according to certain established rites. However,
by Aswaméd, their learned doctors understand
“abnegation of the mind:” for imagination is a
fierce charger, the sacrifice of which is an imperative
duty on the religious ascetic; or it may allude to the
destruction of the animal passions.</p>

<p>They also believe that angelic beings are subject
to concupiscence, and wrath, and the cravings of
hunger and thirst; their food consisting of perfumes
and incense, sacrifices, meat and drink offerings,
with the alms and oblations made by mankind; and
their beverage, the water of life.</p>

<p>They also assert that the stars were holy personages,
who, on leaving this world of gloom, through
the efficacy of religious mortifications became luminous
bodies, ascending from the lower depths of
this abode of the elements to the zenith of the crystalline
sphere; nay, their birth-place, name, family,
with the names of their fathers and grandfathers,
are carefully enumerated in the sacred volumes of
this sect. Thus they say that Sanicher (the slow-traveller)
or Saturn, is the son of the glorious Luminary;
and Mirrikh or Mars, the son of the Earth;
the world-enlightening sun, the issue of <span class="title">Kashyapa</span>,
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
the son of Maríchí, the son of Brahma; Zóhrah (or
the regent of Venus) the son of <span class="title">Bhrigu</span>; and <span class="title">Utáred</span>
(Mercury) the son of <span class="title">Kamer</span> (the regent of the moon).
Some however maintain the moon to be the son of
Attri the Holy, but, according to others he is sprung
from the sea of milk.</p>

<p><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span>
*These opinions contain a marked allusion to
the tenets held by the distinguished Parsi sages,
namely, that the intellectual soul has a relation to
that sphere with which its good actions are connected:
they consequently apply the denomination
of Sun to the spirit of one united to the sun,
and his father is entitled “the father of the Sun.”*</p>

<p>The writer of this work once observed to Shídósh,
the son of Anosh: “Perhaps they mean by the sires
of the stars, their presiding intelligences, as in
the technical language of philosophers, the name
of sires is also given to the intelligences, on which
account Jesus called the Almighty ‘Father.’”</p>

<p>According to them the elements are five in number,
the fifth being the Akas (or ether), which word in
its common acceptation means “the heavens;” but
according to the learned it implies empty space, or
space void of matter. One of their distinguished
doctors, <span class="person">Sumitra</span>, son of the Ray of Kalinga, holds
that <span class="title">Akas</span>, which the Greek Platonists call <dfn>space</dfn>, is
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
simple and uncompounded. Damudar Das Kaul,
a learned Brahman of Kashmir, also holds Akas to
signify <dfn>space</dfn>; and space is understood by the Platonists
among the Yonian to be an extent void of any
substance (a vacuum), which may be divided into
parts, <em>the totality</em> of which <em>parts</em> may be equivalent
to that extent of the general vacuum which is congruous
and equal to it, in such a manner as to comprise
every particle of that extent which is the space
in every <em>particular</em> division of the general space.
There is an extent interposed between two things,
and this extent is void and free of matter. According
to their account, no better interpretation of <dfn>Akas</dfn>
than that which is conveyed by the word space, can
be offered.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
They moreover assert that the heavens have no
existence, and that the constellations and stars are
fixed in the air. According to them there are seven
<span class="title">samudras</span>, that is oceans, on this earth: the salt sea,
that of sugar-cane juice, the sea of spirituous liquors,
that of clarified butter, the sea of curds, the
lacteal, and lastly, that of sweet waters. They also
say that there rises above the earth a mountain
called <span class="title">Su-Meru</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span>
entirely formed of the purest gold,
on which the angelic beings reside, and around
which the stars revolve. There are nine spheres,
namely: those of the seven planets, with those of
<span class="title">Rás</span> and <span class="title">Zanab</span> (the head and tail of the dragon),
which are also borne along in their celestial vehicles.
<span class="title">Rás</span> and <span class="title">Zanab</span> are two demons who drank the water
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
of life, whom Vishnu, at the suggestion of the sun
and moon, smote with a weapon called the <dfn>Chákra</dfn>,
or disk, and rent open their throats; in revenge for
which, the moon is devoured by <span class="title">Rás</span>, and the sun by
<span class="title">Zanab</span>; but as their throats are rent open, whatever
is taken in at the mouth issues at the aperture in
the throat: by this allegory they allude to the lunar
and solar eclipses.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Brahma dwells in a city called <span class="title">Rást Lok</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span>
Vishnu
in a region called <span class="title">Vaikanth</span>; and Mahadeo on a mountain
of silver named <span class="title">Káilasa</span>. They also maintain
that the fixed stars have no actual existence, but
that the objects which shine by night are couches of
gold set with diamonds and rubies, on which the
inhabitants of paradise repose. <span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>*On this Shidosh
remarks: “It is agreed that paradise means the
heavens, and also that the fixed stars are in the
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
eighth heaven; so that, consequently, the heavens
constitute the couches of the souls.”*<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_63" id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>They esteem the majesty of the great light as the
supreme of angelic beings, and on a careful investigation
of their books, acknowledge no existence as
superior to him in dignity; as the constitution of
elemental compounds, and the existence of all beings
is dependent on and connected with his auspicious
essence. They moreover regard Brahma, Vishnu,
and Mahesh, the radiance and reflexion of his light;
saying, it is his majesty alone which, by its acts and
operations, is called by these three names. They
represent him as a sovereign, in the human form,
seated in a chariot which signifies the fourth heaven,
to which are attached seven horses, with angels and
spiritual beings, accompanied by royal trains and
gorgeous pomp, continually passing before his majesty.
They also esteem him as the source of existence
and as universal existence. *They also believe
the earth to be the skin of a Raksh or evil genius,
who was put to death, and his skin stretched out:
the mountains are his bones; the waters his blood;
the trees and vegetables his hair. By Raksh they
mean a demon, which here implies the material
elements on this earth, which according to them
is supported on four legs; alluding in this to the
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
nature and number of the elements, each of which
rests on its own centre.</p>

<p>According to them Saturn limps, which typifies
his long period of revolution; and <dfn>Bhúm</dfn>, or
<dfn>Maríkh</dfn>, “Mars,” is a demon, on which account
they ascribe to him a malignant influence.* <dfn>Zoharah</dfn>,
or “the regent of Venus,” is the director
of the demons, and to this planetary spirit they
ascribe the sciences and religions of the barbarians,
and the creeds of foreign nations.</p>

<p>The Muhammedan doctors say, that Islamism is
connected with this planet, from which source proceeds
the veneration paid by them to Friday, or the
day of Venus. <dfn>Múshteri</dfn>, “Jupiter,” is accounted
the director of the angels, and the teacher of the
system of Brahma, which is conveyed in a celestial
language, not used at present by any beings of elemental
formation: thus, although the Koran is a
divine revelation, the language of it is in general
use among the Arabs; but the four Véds which the
Hindus account a celestial volume, is written in
Sanskrit, a language spoken in no city whatever,
and found in no book, save those of a particular sect:
it is called by them “the speech of angelic beings.”
The Véda was given to them by Brahma, for the
due arrangement of human concerns. By angels
or divine beings, they mean eloquent speakers, and
learned authors, who, being illuminated by the
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
effulgence of primitive wisdom, interpreted whatever
was revealed to them. It is to be remarked,
that every one who pleases may derive from the
Védas arguments in favour of his particular creed,
to such a degree, that they can support by clear proofs
the philosophical, mystical, unitarian, and atheistical
systems, faith, and religion; Hinduism,

<p>They say that the Almighty is a great body, and
that all other beings are in his belly; which resembles
the opinions maintained by the venerable Shaikh
Shahbáb ud deen Maktúl, whose tomb may God sanctify!
namely, that the universe is one body, which
contains all others in existence, and is called the
universal body. It has one spirit, which comprehends
all others, and is called the universal soul;
and one single object of intelligence, from which
they derive all intelligences, calling it the universal
intelligence. It is stated in the Mujmal al Hikmat,
or Compendium of Philosophy, that the Almighty
is the spirit of spirit; and according to <dfn>Azar Húshangian</dfn>,
“the intellect of intellect.” <cite>Shaikh Bó Ali</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_64" id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span>

(whose place of repose may God illuminate!) thus
speaks:</p>

  <div class="i0">The different angelic hosts are the senses of this frame;</div>
  <div class="i0">The bodies, the elements, and the three kingdoms are its members;</div>
  <div class="i0">All these are comprehended in the divine unity; all other things are illusion.”</div>
 </div>

<p>This sect gives the appellation of <span class="title">Rakshas</span>, which
means evil genii or demons, to all those who do not

works.</p>

<p>Time, in Hindawi <dfn>Kal</dfn>, is a measure of the movement
of the great sphere, according to the philosophers
of Greece and Persia. The author has also
heard from the Brahmans, and in conformity to the
opinions ascribed to the most distinguished persons
of their caste, it is stated in the work entitled <cite>Muadan
Ushshaffai Iskandari</cite> (a selection taken from several
Hindi medical treatises), that time, according to the
Hindu philosophers, is a necessarily-subsisting immaterial
substance, durable, incorporeal, that will ever
last, and admits not of annihilation. Time has been
divided into three kinds, namely, past, present, and
future; but, as in their opinion time admits neither
of alteration nor extinction, these divisions are not
in reality its attributes, although correctly used
when applied to acts performed in time. According
to the succession of acts, they figuratively describe
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
time as past, present, and future; as in reference to
the solar revolutions and phases, they call it by the
names of days, nights, months, years, and seasons:
in short, they have so many intricate distinctions of
this same nature, that the mere attempt to enumerate
them would fill several volumes. They all
agree that this world is to continue for four ages:
the first, the <dfn>Rast yug</dfn>, “the righteous,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_65" id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span>
which lasted
one million seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand
common years; during which, all human beings,
high and low, exalted and humble, princes
and servants, adhered to the practice of righteousness
and truth, passing their glorious existence in a
manner conformable to the divine will, and devoted
to the worship of the Almighty; the duration of
human life in this age extended to one hundred
thousand common years. The second, the <dfn>Treta
Yug</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span>
which lasted one million two hundred and
ninety-six thousand common years: during this
period, three-fourths of the human race conformed
to the divine will, and the natural duration of life
extended to ten thousand years. The third was
the <dfn>Dwapar Yug</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_67" id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
which lasted eight hundred and
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
sixty-four thousand ordinary years, during which
one half the human race performed good works and
their life was limited to a thousand years. The
fourth is the <dfn>Kali Yug</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_68" id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span>
or “iron age,” which is to
last four hundred and thirty-two thousand years,
during which three-fourths of the human race will
be immersed in sin, infatuation, and evil works, and
the term of human life reduced to a hundred and
twenty ordinary years. These four ages (4,320,000
years) they call a <span class="title">Chakra</span>, and seventy-one Chakras
a <span class="title">Manwantar</span>; on the expiration of seventy-one Chakras,
there elapses one day of the life of India, the
ruler of the upper world; and on the expiration of
fourteen Manwantars, reckoned according to the
preceding calculation, one day of Brahma’s life is
terminated.</p>

<p>They say, that the Almighty, having united himself
with Brahma’s body, created the world through
his medium: Brahma thus became the Creator, and
brought mankind into existence, making them of
four classes, namely: the <span class="title">Brahman</span>, <span class="title">Chattriya</span>, <span class="title">Vaisya</span>,
and <span class="title">Sùdra</span>. To the first were assigned the
custody of laws and the establishment of religious
ordinances; the second class was formed for the
purposes of government and external authority,
being appointed the medium for introducing order
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">49</span>
into human affairs; the third was composed of husbandmen,
cultivators, artisans, and tradesmen; and
the fourth for every description of service and
attendance. All races not comprised in one of these
four divisions are not accounted of human origin
but of demoniacal descent: however the demons or
Rakshas, through the practice of religious austerities,
attained to such dignity that Brahma, Vishnu,
and Mahesh (Siva) became their attendants. Thus
Rávan,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span>
through the efficacy of religious mortification,
became lord of the world and its inhabitants;
Brahma was reader of the Vedas at his court; the
sun filled the office of cook; the clouds were his
cup-bearers, and the wind his chamberlain.</p>

<p><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span>Finally, according to the sectaries, the life of
Brahma lasts a hundred extraordinary years of three
hundred and sixty days, with nights corresponding
to the days,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span>
so that up to the present time, that is,
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
the period of composing this work, in the year of the
Hejira 1055 (A. D. 1645), there have elapsed four
thousand seven hundred and forty-six years of the
Kali-Yug. So many Brahmas have appeared, that
the sums of their years exceed the limits of human
comprehension; they have merely a tradition that
one thousand Brahmas have successively appeared
and been annihilated; so that the present is the
thousand and first, of whose life fifty years and
half a day are expired, which commences the half-day
of the fifty-first year. As soon as the age of
Brahma terminates, according to the preceding calculation,
or amounts to the destined number, he
then forms twelve blazing suns, whose heat and
splendor consume alike both earth and water, so
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
that there remains not a vestige of this world or its
productions, and mankind plunge beneath the waters,
which catastrophe is called <span class="title">Pralaya</span>, in Hindawi:
after this event, another Brahma appears and creates
the world anew, which process of dissolution
and reproduction continues to all eternity. The
<cite>Hakim Umr Khakani</cite> says:</p>

 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Those who adorn the heavens, which are a particle of time,</div>
  <div class="i0">Come, and depart again, re-appear on the same stage&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">For, in the skirts of heaven and the robe of earth, there is</div>
  <div class="i0">A creation which is successively born as long as God exists.”</div>
 </div>

<p>By the prolonged periods of duration ascribed to
these celestial personages, they allude to the antiquity
of the world, which is so immensely great that
it cannot be comprised in numbers. The man of
spiritual attributes, Shídosh, the son of Anosh,
says: “On the termination of the great cycle, human
creatures reappear, and the water enveloping the
terrestrial globe becomes of the same radical
constitution as the waters on high; again, through
the intense heat of the luminary, the water disappears,
and twelve suns are formed: from the
ascent of vapors and the blending of exhalations,
the celestial disks are enveloped, when the tailed
comets, which the Persians call ‘minor suns,’ and
the Arabs <dfn>Shamseyat</dfn>, or ‘smaller solar bodies,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span>
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
* consume alike the humid and the dry: such is
the necessary termination of that cycle: the
world and its inhabitants will be created anew.” *
Mulla Ismail Suffi, of Isfahan, says:</p>

 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i2a">“The world which is one, the creator, and the creation,</div>
  <div class="i2">Both these worlds are like the scum of his cup;</div>
  <div class="i2">This revolution of time resembles a painted lantern,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, notwithstanding its motion, remains in the same position.”</div>
 </div>

<p>The assertion “that only the four classes above
enumerated are of human race,” implies that this
denomination is attached to the professors of humanity,
virtue, and discrimination; superior to
which is showing mercy to the animal creation;
also the knowledge of one’s self and of the Creator;
nay, the person destitute of these characteristics has
no share of the nature of man. Thus the sage
Ferdusi says:</p>

 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Whoever deviates from the path of humanity</div>
  <div class="i0">Is to be accounted a demon, and not of human race.”</div>
 </div>

<p>According to these sectaries, the worship offered
to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the
statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be
commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them
to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means
the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is
merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular
form, the Being who has neither accident
nor form.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
Moreover, as mankind is an assemblage composed
of superiors and inferiors, they have made images of
the directors of the people, and constituted them
their Kiblah: besides, as all things exhibit the
power of the Almighty, they form images according
to their similitude. They also say, that as the Avátars
are radiant emanations of the divine essence,
they therefore make images on their likeness, and
pay them worship: so that, whatever is excellent in
its kind, in the mineral, vegetable, or animal world,
is regarded with veneration, as well as the uncompounded
elementary substances, and the starry
spheres. Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:</p>

 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,</div>
  <div class="i0">Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”</div>

 Vámana was so small, that in his journey, when he got to the side
of a hole made by a cow’s foot, and which was filled with water, he
thought it was a river, and entreated another Brahman to help him over
it. On coming into Bali’s presence, he petitioned only for as much land
as he could measure by three steps; and the king ordered his priest, notwithstanding
his remonstrances, to read the usual formulas in making
such a present. Vámana then placed one foot on India’s heaven, and the
other on the earth; when lo! a third leg suddenly projected from his
belly, and he asked for a place upon which he might rest his third foot.
Bali then, by his wife’s advice, gave his head for Vámana to set his foot
upon; Vámana next asked for a Dakshina, “a small present which
accompanies a gift;” but Bali was unable to comply, as he had now lost
every thing: in this dilemma he offered his life, which Vishnu declined
taking, as he had promised Prahláda not to destroy any of his race.
He therefore gave him his choice of ascending to heaven, taking with
him five ignorant men; or descending to Patála, the world of the hydras,
with five wise men. Bali chose the latter, as Vishnu promised to protect
him against suffering punishment there for his crimes on earth.</p>

 Rĭshi, a kind of saint; that holy and superhuman personage which

 <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">अश्वमेध</span> <dfn>aśvamédha</dfn>, from <dfn>aśva</dfn>, “a horse,” and <dfn>médha</dfn>, “a sacrifice.”
Colebrooke, in his Essay on the Védas (<cite><abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="Eight, edition Calcutta">VIII., ed. Calc.</abbr>)
states, that the horse is “avowedly an emblem of <dfn>Viráj</dfn>, or the primeval
and universal manifested being. In the last section of the <cite>Taittiríya
Yajurvéda</cite>, the various parts of the horse’s body are described as
divisions of time and portions of the universe: morning is his head;
the sun, his eye; air, his breath; the moon, his ear; etc. A similar
passage in the fourteenth book of the <cite>Sátapat´ha bráhmańa</cite>, describes
the same allegorical horse for the meditation of such as cannot perform
an Aśvamédha; and the assemblage of living animals, constituting an
imaginary victim at a real Aśvamédha, equally represent the universal
Being, according to the doctrines of the Indian scripture. It is not
however certain, whether this ceremony did not also give occasion to
the institution of another, apparently not authorized by the Védas, in
which a horse was actually sacrificed.” That this was really the case,
we may infer from the frequent mention of such sacrifices, made in the
historical poems of the Hindus and from the analogous instances of them
found among the Western nations. The Massageti and the Persíans
sacrificed horses to the sun; the Magians also to the rivers (see <cite><abbr title="Heroditus">Herod.</abbr></cite>,

 This passage, relative to space, is as obscure as the subject itself is
metaphysical. The notions here expressed are in accordance with the
Vedanta doctrine, by which <dfn>akas</dfn>, or “pure ether,” is the universal
space, including all, and the vacuum between the separate objects therein.
There is a vacuum unconnected with every thing, and in it these particular
vacuums are absorbed. This appears conformable enough with
modern philosophy, but the Hindus applied it to the divine spirit itself:
thus, they say that there is a perfect spirit, in which individual souls and
the aggregation of all souls take refuge, and so Brahma and the individuated
spirits are one: both pure life. We may here recollect that sir
Isaac Newton, in attempting to define space, compared it to “Something
like the organ of divinity.” According to the Vedanta-sara, there is
no difference between the all-ruling spirit and that of the sage; as there is
none between the forest and the trees and the inclosed atmosphere; or
between the lake and the parts of the water, and the image of the sky
which falls in it. We are informed by Damascius, an author of the sixth
century of our era, who quotes Eudemos, a disciple of Aristotle (<cite>Wolfií</cite>
<cite>Anect. Græca</cite>, <abbr title="tome Three page">t. III. p.</abbr> 259), that the united intellectual all is called
“space” by the Magians and by the whole race of the Arians, which
name may be applied to the nations inhabiting the countries situated
to the East and West of the Indus.&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

 The earth according to the Hindus is circular and flat, like the flower of
the water-lily, in which the petals project beyond each other: its circumference
being four thousand millions of miles. In the centre is mount
Sumeru, ascending six hundred thousand miles from the surface of the
earth, and descending one hundred and twenty-eight thousand below it.
It is one hundred and twenty-eight thousand miles in circumference at
its base, and two hundred and fifty-six thousand wide at the top. On
this mountain are the heavens of Vishnu, Siva, Indra, Agni, Yama,
Noirita, Varúna, Váyú, Kúvéra, Isha, and other gods. The clouds ascend
to about one-third of the height of the mountain: at its base are the
mountains Mandara, Gundha-mádana, Vipúla, and Súpárshwa, on each
of which grows a tree eight thousand eight hundred miles high (<cite>Ward’s

was about to drink it, when, informed of it by the sun and the moon, the

8. at the age of three years they

or the ceremony of forming
the crest at the first tonsure of a Hindu. They are
strictly enjoined to observe the above eight ceremonies;
and if the child be of the female sex, they
practise the same rites, but without the stated forms
of prayer; excepting at the time of her marriage,
when they are bound to recite the forms appropriated
to that ceremony. 9. In his fifth year, they
bind around the child’s waist a string which they
call <dfn>Sútram</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span>

10. three

about

13. when the boy reaches his fifteenth year, they

<dfn>Viváhah</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span>
or “matrimony;” 14. the son, after the decease

when the majesty of the
great luminary is in Aquarius, they are to present
the Brahmans with pulse, barley, wheat, black rice,
sesamé, gold, and suchlike; this is called <span class="title">Dán-phal</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span>
16. on the <dfn>Shiva-rátri</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span>
or “night of Siva,” the 21st
of the <span class="time">Bhágan</span> (Phágan, or Phálgun) they present to
the Brahmans a serpent of silver, with red rice,
which they call <span class="title">Phani</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The above are the sixteen ceremonies. It is moreover
necessary that a Brahman’s son should be
invested with the Munji at the age of eight, the Chatriyas
at eleven, and the Vaisyas at twelve, after which
ceremony the boy is to be sent to school.</p>

<p>A Brahman must, whilst performing the offices of
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
nature, fasten the Munji securely on the right ear,
turning his face to the north, but at night to the
south. After performing these offices, he is to take
his instrument, and going three paces farther he
is to apply to his hands water, which is to be in
a vessel, and with which earth has been blended,
and this is to be continued until there remains
no disagreeable odour. He is after this to perform
his ablution in a clean place,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span>
and seat himself
in such a manner that his hands should be under
his knees, with his face to the north or east; next,
whilst repeating the prescribed forms of prayer, he
is to put a little water three times successively into
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
the palm of the right hand,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span>
which he is to swallow
without reciting any prayers; he is then to cleanse
the mouth with the back of the left hand, and having
taken into the palm of his hand other water, and
dipped the other fingers into it, he is to apply them
to his nose, eyes, and ears; the water must be pure,
without foam or bubble. On this occasion the Brahman
is to swallow so much water that the moisture
may extend to his breast; the Chattri such a quantity
as to extend to his throat; the Vaisya sufficient
to moisten the inside of his mouth; the cultivator,
women, and children who have not assumed the
Munji, are to apply a little water to the lips, then
immerse the head, and having repeated the proper
forms of prayer, to sprinkle the head several times.
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
The Brahman is next to compress the nostrils, so
that the passage of inhalation and exhalation should
be closed up, and recite the prayers prescribed on
the occasion; then he is to stand for some time,
turning his face towards the great luminary, and
repeat the necessary formulæ. Every morning, on
rising up and performing duly the offices of nature,
he is to go through the necessary rites which they
call <dfn>Sandhya</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_98" id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span>
the observance of which, three times
every day, is equally imperative on both Brahman
and Chattriya: 1. every morning, or from the dawn
of day until the rise of the world-illuminating solar
orb; 2. at midday, from the sun’s meridian altitude
to his declination; 3. at evening, or from one hour
before the setting of the world-enlightening sun until
the rising of the stars. These rites are to be accompanied
by <dfn>Ghasal</dfn>, or “ablution,” except on the
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
Sandhya of the latter part of the day, when, if it
be impossible, the established prayers only are to be
recited. On performing this ablution, the head is
to be several times sprinkled with water in such a
manner that it may fall in drops on it; after which,
having gone through the indispensable forms of
prayer, he is to make the <dfn>Homa</dfn>, that is, he is to light
the holy fire on a pure spot, and place on it thin and
fine pieces of wood, and having chosen the still more
delicate splinters of it, and moistened them with
water, he drops pure rice upon them. The fire
being thus lighted, he addresses prayers to his spiritual
guide or his instructor, father, and elders, and
laying his head on the ground, solicits their benedictions;
pronouncing during this adoration his own
name, so that it may be heard by them, after this
manner: “I, who am such a one, in profound
adoration address my prayers to you, and prostrate
myself in your presence:” the same prostration
must also be performed to his mother.
He then repairs to his master, before whom he
stands in an humble attitude and receives instruction:
but after this form, that the instructor should say of
himself, “I am now at leisure:” he is not to command
him, which would be accounted great rudeness.
When the pupil waits on his master, he is
to appear before him dressed in costly clothing; but
if both master and pupil should be in indigent circumstances,
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
the latter is to solicit alms, and thus
procure subsistence for his master and himself: he
is moreover to remain silent at table.</p>

<p>The boy, when invested with the Brahminical
thread, is called a <dfn>Brahmachari</dfn>, until he enters into
the marriage state; after which, if through the necessity
of his own family he derives his daily support
from another quarter, he is not to eat at one place
only, but go round to several doors, and receiving
something at each, convey the whole to its proper
destination; but the person, whose father and mother
charge themselves with his annual support,
and who can discover no other Brahman beside himself
in that district, is allowed to satisfy his appetite
at one place. Until the time of his marriage, the
Brahmachari eats not honey, never applies collyrium
to the eyes, nor oil nor perfumes to the body; and
never eats the viands left at table, except his master’s;
he never utters a rejoinder with harshness or
severity; avoids female intercourse; and never looks
at the great luminary when rising or setting; he is
a stranger to falsehood, and never uses an expression
of ill omen; nor holds any one in detestation,
or regards him as an object of reproach; above all,
he shows exceeding veneration to his preceptor.</p>

<p>The ancients commanded that boys should be
engaged in the study of the Veds, or “religious
sciences,” from five years of age to twelve. They
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
have also said: “A Brahman should study the four
Védas;” but as the acquisition of the whole is
impossible, their learned men are consequently
satisfied with the knowledge of small portions of
each. The first is the <dfn>Rigvéda</dfn>, which treats concerning
the knowledge of the Divine essence and
attributes; the mode of creation; the path of righteousness;
of life and death. The second, or <dfn>Yajúsh-véda</dfn>,
treats of the rules prescribed for religious ceremonies,
faith, burnt offerings, and prayers. The
third is the <dfn>Sámavéda</dfn>, which treats of the science of
music, the proper mode of reading the Védas, and
the portions selected from them; from this source
are also derived vocal and instrumental harmony.
The fourth is the <dfn>Atharva-véda</dfn>, which includes the
rules of archery, the prayers proper to be recited
when encountering the foe and discharging arrows
against them. If a person acquainted with this
system and form of prayer discharge a single arrow,
it becomes a hundred thousand arrows, some of
which contain fire, others wind, storm, dust, and
rain; others vomit forth golden stones and huge
bricks; whilst some assume the forms of tremendous
wild beasts and ferocious animals, which strike
terror into the boldest hearts. Many are the extraordinary
modes and wonderful devices unfolded in
this Véda for the total destruction of one’s enemies.
Such is the Atharva Véda, and such the artifices,
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
magic practices, incantations, spells, and devices
contained in it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_99" id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
The <span class="title">Brahmachárí</span> is of two kinds: one as already
described, whom the Brahmans call Brahmachari,
until the period of his becoming a householder and
taking a wife; the second is he who in the course of
this life never enters into the married state, pays no
attention to worldly cares, and continues the devoted
servant of his instructor, on whose death he pays
the same attention to his survivors. If the disciple
should happen to die in his master’s house or that
of his successor, it is accounted far more meritorious
than in any other place; and if his decease should
not occur, he is carefully to worship the fire which
is made for the purpose of the Hom, or “burnt-offering,”
and diminishing every day the quantity
of his food.</p>

<p>Having thus given some statements concerning
the Brahmachárí, it now becomes proper to mention
the various modes of contracting marriage
among the Hindus: thus it is related in the first part
of the <span class="title">Mahábhárat</span>, that a woman who has lost her
husband may lawfully take another; for when Parasu-Rama
had exterminated the Chattris, their wives
held intercourse with the Brahmans and bare them
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
children. It is also permitted to a wife deprived of
her husband, to attach herself to another; thus
<span class="person">Yojanagandhá</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span>
was first the wife of <span class="person">Paraśara</span>, by
whom she had a son, the celebrated sage <span class="person">Vyása</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span>
and she afterwards became the wife of a king named
<span class="person">Santana</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_102" id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span>
In the same work it is also recorded, that
a woman may, by her husband’s consent, maintain
intercourse with another; thus, on the arrival of
Raja Bali, a Brahman named <span class="person">Tamma</span>, sent him his
wife and obtained a son. In like manner, Raja
<span class="person">Pándu</span>, who abstained from all intercourse with
woman, permitted his wife <span class="person">Kuntí</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span>
to keep company
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
with others, and she, by force of his prayers, mixing
with angels, had sons. In like manner it is permitted
that the son be separated from the father,
but remain with the mother, and that, on the decease
of a brother, another brother by a different
father but the same mother, may marry the widow
of the deceased: thus <span class="person">Vyása</span>, the son of <span class="person">Yojangandha</span>
by <span class="person">Párasaru</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span>
visited the wives of <span class="person">Vichitra-Virya</span>,
who was born of the same mother, Yojangandha,
by king Santanu, and there was born to him
<span class="person">Dhritaráshtra</span>, Raja <span class="person">Pándu</span>, and <span class="person">Vidúra</span>. It is also
allowed that several individuals of the same race
and religion may among them espouse one wife:
thus <span class="person">Draupadí</span>, daughter of <span class="person">Drúpada</span>, Rája of <span class="person">Pánchála</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span>
was married to the five Pandava princes;
and <span class="person">Ahalyá</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span>
the daughter of <span class="person">Gautama</span>, to seven persons;
and the daughter of another holy person,
was married to ten husbands. The Yezdanians
ascribe the seclusion of women, and their not choosing
husbands for themselves, to litigation, corruption,
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
and the family perplexities. It is recorded
also in the Mahábhárat, that in ancient times there
was no such practice as the appropriation of husband
and wife; every woman being allowed to cohabit
with whomsoever she thought proper, until
once the wife of a holy personage being in the society
of another, Swétakéta, the holy man’s son, feeling
indignant at such conduct, pronounced this imprecation:
“Let the woman who approaches a stranger
be regarded as a spirit of hell!” and at present
the brute creation, which possess in common with
us, immaterial souls, act according to the ancient
law: many, also, of the northern nations follow the
same practice. In the same work it is also stated,
that the sage Vyása was born of the daughter of a
fisherman, whom the sage Paraśara espoused, from
which it follows that the issue of such a low connection
is not to be held as a low or degraded character.
Thus far has been extracted from the Mahábhárat.</p>

<p>According to the Smarttas, there are two kinds
of wives: the first is the legitimate wife, who is
degraded by holding intercourse with any man save
her husband: the second are those on whom no
restraints are imposed; of whom there are numbers
at the disposition of their chief men. The princes
of ancient times, to all appearance, established this
description of females for the purpose of receiving
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
travellers and pilgrims, an act which they regarded
as productive of great blessings.</p>

<p>Moreover, on account of the increase of the male
population, they held not as a criminal act the
holding an intercourse with these females; but
regarded guilt to consist in being intimate with a
woman who has a husband: they moreover esteemed
it a base act to defraud the licensed class of their
hire. Tradition records that, in former times, the
<dfn>Lulees</dfn>, or “dancing women,” who inhabited the
temple of the Tortoise in the city of Kalinga, at first
gave their daughters to a Brahman, in order to conciliate
the favor of the Almighty and insure future
happiness; but that afterwards they gave them from
selfish purposes, and exposed them from mercenary
motives; even at present, although they have entirely
given up every pious purpose, yet they do not associate
with any save those of their own religion.
However, Shir Muhammed Khan, who was appointed
military governor of that province under the first
sovereign, Abdálláh Kuteb Shah, forced them to
repair to the houses of the Moslem: notwithstanding
which, the Lulees of the temple of Jagganath, to this
very day hold no intercourse with the Muhammedans.
In Gaya and Soram, when they take a wife,
she must be of noble and honorable descent, and of
graceful carriage; and must not previously have been
affianced to any other person; she is not to be related,
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
in the remotest degree, to the stock or family
of her husband, she ought to have brothers, and her
lineage and family for ten generations are to be publicly
known among her contemporaries. Her relations
also make strict inquiries into the merits and
demerits of the bridegroom, particularly as to the
state of his health and stamina. Some writers assert,
that a Brahman may occasionally demand in
marriage the daughter of a Chattri, merchant, or
cultivator, but on this condition, that they do not join
their husband in partaking of food or drink.</p>

<p>Among the Hindus there are five modes of contracting
marriage;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span>
the first, or <span class="title">Viváha</span>, after this
form: the damsel’s father looks out for a son-in-law,
to whom he presents money and goods in proportion
to his means, and gives him his daughter, which
is the most legitimate mode.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span>
The second is the
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
<span class="title">Asurvívahah</span>, when without the consent of the father
or mother, by employing force and violence, or the
influence of money, the damsel is forcibly taken by
the bridegroom from her parents’ house to his own,
and there married to him. The third is the <span class="title">Gandharviváhah</span>,
when the bridegroom takes the damsel
away with her consent, but without the approbation
of her parents, and espouses her at his own
house. The fourth is the <span class="title">Rákshasa-viváha</span>, when the
parties on both sides are at the head of armies, and
the damsel, being taken away by force, becomes the
victor’s bride.</p>

<p>The fifth is the <span class="title">Písácha-viváha</span>, when the lover,
without obtaining the sanction of the girl’s parents,
takes her home by means of talismans, incantations,
and such like magical practices, and then
marries her. Písách, in Sanscrit, is the name of
a demon, which takes whatever person it fixes
on, and as the above kind of marriage takes place
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
after the same manner, it has been called by this
name.</p>

<p>On espousing a damsel, the intelligent Brahman,
having taken the bride’s hand into his own, must
go through the established forms prescribed by his
faith, and move seven steps in advance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_109" id="fnanchor_109"></a><a href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></span>
When he
espouses the daughter of a Chattrí, at the time of
solemnizing the marriage, an arrow is to be held at
one extremity by the bridegroom, and at the other
by the bride; on contracting an alliance with a
merchant’s daughter, the bride and bridegroom are
to hold a scourge or some similar object in the same
manner; on his marriage with the virgin daughter of
a cultivator, the parties mark their union by a token
of secret intimacy. When they deliver the bride
to her husband, if her father be not alive, or her
paternal grandfather, or if her brothers be not forthcoming
on the occasion, then the most respectable
person of the tribe or family is to perform the necessary
ceremonies; and if the relations be not intelligent,
then the damsel’s mother.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked, that when a girl attains the
proper age for entering into the married state,
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
if her parents, notwithstanding their ability, do not
provide a husband for her, they commit a great sin.
If a distinguished suitor should not present himself,
they are however to provide a husband of a good
family; this they are to perform only once in their
lives, as on the husband’s death it is unlawful for
the widow to become the wife of another person:
after her husband’s decease, she is obliged to pass
the rest of her life in his house. If, previous to advancing
the seven steps prescribed at the time of contracting
the marriage, there should present himself
a more distinguished suitor than the former, it is
allowed to take the damsel from the former and
give her to the latter, as before advancing the seven
paces, the matrimonial contract is not binding.
Should a wife prove to be immoral, all intercourse
with her must terminate; but putting her to death
or turning her out of doors, are also forbidden: she
is to be confined to a small and dark chamber,
clad in a coarse dress, and to receive food but
once a day.</p>

<p>The period of a woman’s illness, according to the
Brahmans, extends to sixteen days: on the four
days following the first day of the symptoms, all
intercourse with her is forbidden. Women are
strictly enjoined to show the greatest respect to their
husbands, parents, brothers, and relations, and to
use every possible exertion for the preservation of
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
their husbands’ property. When he goes on a journey,
she is not to deck her person, nor appear cheerful
and smiling; she is not to go to entertainments,
to the houses of her acquaintances or relations, nor
invite them to hers.</p>

<p>As long as a girl is unmarried, it is necessary to
guard her with the closest attention; but, when
married, this would be highly improper, with this
restriction however, that it is by no means fitting
that a female, from her tenderest years to the period
of her maturity, should be allowed unlimited liberty:
on the contrary, she is to be ever submissive and
obedient to her father, husband, and relations: but
if these should not be in existence, the actual rulers
are to take care of her state.</p>

<p>When the husband is on a journey, the wife is
not to remain alone in the house, but is to repair to
the dwelling of her parents, brethren, or relations;
and if, on her husband’s death, she become not a
<dfn>Sattee</dfn>, that is, burn herself with the deceased, she
is then to reside with his relations, devoting herself
to rigid abstinence and the worship of the Almighty.
They say that when a woman becomes a <span class="title">Sattee</span>, the
Almighty pardons all the sins committed by the
wife and husband, and that they remain a long
time in paradise:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span>
nay, if the husband were in the
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
infernal regions, the wife by this means draws him
from thence and takes him to paradise; just as the
serpent-catcher charms the serpent out of his hole.
Moreover the Sattee, in a future birth, returns not
to the female sex; but should she reassume the
human nature, she appears as a man; but she who
becomes not a Sattee, and passes her life in widowhood,
is never emancipated from the female state.
It is therefore the duty of every woman, excepting
one that is pregnant, to enter into the blazing fire
along with her deceased husband; a Brahman’s wife
in particular is to devote herself in the same fire with
her husband; but others are allowed to perform the
rite in a separate place. It is however criminal to
force the woman into the fire, and equally so to prevent
her who voluntarily devotes herself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_111" id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
The enlightened doctors say, that by a woman’s
becoming a Sattee is meant that, on her husband’s
decease, she should consume in the fire along with
him all her desires, and thus die before the period
assigned by nature; as in metaphysical language
woman signifies “passion,” or in other words, she
is to cast all her passions into the fire; but not throw
herself into it along with the deceased, which is
far from being praiseworthy. A respectable woman
must not from vanity expose herself to the gaze of
a stranger, but she is to wear a dress which will
completely cover her to the sole of the foot.</p>

<p>It is to be noted, that the son of a Brahman by a
Chattri female is not of the father’s caste, but a
superior Chattri. It is moreover laid down as a rule
that a Brahman, on becoming a Brahmachárí, should
regularly worship the fire, which fire he is to discontinue
at the time of the marriage contract; but
on that occasion he is bound to light another fire
and to recite the prescribed prayers, so that it may
be as a witness of the compact entered into between
husband and wife: also, after the celebration of the
marriage, they are to repeat the prayers prescribed
at the time of lighting the fire which they are ever
after to worship daily.</p>

<p>The Brahman is moreover to offer up <dfn>Hóma</dfn>, or
burnt offerings, at the rising and setting of the great
luminary, and to partake of food twice; once during
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
the day on the expiration of two watches (midday);
the second time at night, on the expiration of one
watch: he is also to assist with food and clothing,
to the utmost of his power, the indigent, and friends
who come to his house.</p>

<p>The Chattri is to learn the Védas and Shasters,
or the divine revelations and sciences, but he is not
to teach them to another; he is likewise to perform
Hóma, or “burnt-offerings.” His occupation consists
in governing and protecting the human race,
for which reason all monarchs were anciently of
the Chattri class, the more effectually to establish
the righteous decrees of Brahma, and the institutions
of the Brahmans.</p>

<p>To the Bakkál, or “merchant caste,” appertains
the profession of buying, selling, and commercial
transactions, the protection of animals, and agriculture,
which is attended with profit.</p>

<p>The cultivator, who is called <span class="title">Dalmah</span>, or <span class="title">Kumbí</span>,
is enjoined to engage in service, to practise tillage,
or any employment within his capacity by which he
can gain a maintenance; there are in fact no limits
prescribed as to the nature of his occupations.</p>

<p>All four classes are strictly enjoined not to injure
any living being whatever, especially not to deprive
any one arbitrarily of life; to speak the truth, to act
uprightly, and as long as they live not to defraud a
fellow-creature of his wealth.</p>

<p><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
Every Brahman is obliged once a year to celebrate
the established rite of <dfn>Yajna</dfn>, or “sacrifice:” if he be
in indigent circumstances, he is to go round to his
brethren, and expend whatever he collects in the
Yajna, which is thus performed: there are three
<dfn>Kundams</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_112" id="fnanchor_112"></a><a href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span>
or “fire-pits” to be formed, in front of
which is fixed a wooden post; then a rope made of
Durva grass (in Sanskrit, <span class="trans">Kúsá</span>) is thrown around
the neck of a black he-goat, and fastened to that
post; <span class="title">Hóm</span> is then offered up during five days; on
the first day, the sacrificer and his wife both perform
their ablutions, nine Brahmans at the same time
going through the rite of washing their heads and
persons; of these nine, one is looked upon as Brahma
himself, all present obeying his commands, and the
remaining eight Brahmans waiting obsequiously on
him. In addition to these, sixteen more Brahmans
are required, who are to recite by themselves the
<dfn>Mantra</dfn>, or “forms of prayer,” at the moment of the
<dfn>Hóm</dfn>, or “burnt-offering.” In order to light the
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
fire, they bring small pieces of a wood which in
Sanscrit they call <span class="trans">Arana</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span>
in Hindi, <span class="trans">Ak</span> (asclepias
gigantea); and also for the same purpose another
kind, in Sanskrit, <span class="trans">Khandíra</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_114" id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span>
in Telinga, <span class="trans">Chandaru</span>;
for the Homa, a wood in Sanskrit called <span class="trans">Pámárak</span>, in
Telinga, <span class="trans">Utarini</span>, in Dakhani <span class="trans">Akhárah</span>, of which they
make tooth-picks; also a wood, in Sanskrit <span class="trans">Udámvarah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_115" id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span>
(ficus racemosa), in Telinga, <span class="trans">Miri</span>, in Dakhani,
<span class="trans">Kular</span>, in Parsi <dfn>Anjir dasti</dfn>, or “wild fig;” and another
wood, in Sanskrit <span class="trans">samí</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span>
and in Telinga, <span class="trans">Khammi</span>;
also a grass, named in Sanskrit <span class="trans">Dúrvá</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_117" id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span>
in Telinga,
<span class="trans">Kargi</span>, in Dakhani, <span class="trans">Haryálí</span>; also another sort, called
<span class="trans">Darbas</span>: altogether nine are required. The eight
Brahmans first mentioned having repeated the proper
incantation, lay hold of the goat in such a manner
that they make it lie down on a bed formed of
the leaves and branches of the tree <dfn>Khartarhari</dfn>, or
<dfn>Karshartari</dfn>, in Sanskrit, <dfn>Kaliśakha</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_118" id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span>
in Telinga, <dfn>Balsúkúma</dfn>,
and in Dakhani <dfn>Karankabánta</dfn>. In the next
place, the sixteen Brahmans, having recited the
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
formula, or appropriate Mantra, stop up all the animal’s
orifices, so that he can neither exhale nor
inhale, and keep him in that position until he dies.
Then one of the sixteen Brahmans, cutting off the
head at one blow, flays the carcase and cuts it up
into small pieces, throwing away all the bones to
some distance, and then mixes up clarified butter
with the flesh. The eight Brahmans next lay it
piece by piece on the fire, whilst the other sixteen
are employed in throwing on the above mentioned
kinds of wood, and pouring clarified butter on
them. The eight Brahmans eat of the meat thus
roasted; the person who offers the sacrifice also partakes
of it; after which he gives among all the officiating
Brahmans one hundred and one cows with
their calves, along with a <dfn>dakshinah</dfn>, or “presents of
money.” Hóma must also be performed on the
second day, and gifts presented to the Brahmans;
on the three following days, they recite the appropriate
Mantras, and light up the fire in the manner
before described, but lay no meat upon it; in short,
during the whole five days, they entertain all Brahmans
who present themselves, offering up perfumes
and giving presents to each of them. On the expiration
of the five days, they completely fill and stop up
two of the fire-receptacles, leaving the third, which
they do not close up until they have removed the fire
it contains to their dwelling: as the fire on this
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
occasion had been made outside the city, they erect
there a house which they burn down on the completion
of the ceremony. When they have taken the
fire to their dwelling, they deposit it in a peculiar
receptacle excavated for the purpose; they offer up
the <span class="title">Hóma</span> daily, never suffering this fire to go out:
they also make a covering for it, which they remove
at the time of offering up the Hóma.</p>

<p>The manner of offering the <span class="title">Hóma</span> is as follows:
the sacrificer having performed his ablution and
made the <dfn>tilek</dfn>, or “inaugural mark,” on the forehead
with ashes from the fire receptacle, then celebrates
the Hóma; the rites must be performed by a
Brahman, as it is of no avail when performed by
any other. If the officiating Brahman be a <dfn>Vaishnavah</dfn>,
“worshipper of Vishnu,” he performs the <dfn>Yajna</dfn>,
or “sacrifice,” in the same manner, excepting that,
instead of a goat, he employs the figure of a goat
formed of flour, over which he goes through the
established ceremonies. When one goat is sacrificed,
it is called <dfn>Agnishtóma</dfn>, or “sacrifice to Agni;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_119" id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span>
where two are offered, <dfn>Yúnyíkam</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_120" id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span>
the sacrifice of
three is called <dfn>Wajpéya</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
the sacrifice of four is
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
called <dfn>Jyotishtóma</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span>
and the sacrifice of five is named
<dfn>Panjáham</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span>
When they sacrifice a cow after this
manner, it is called the <dfn>Gomédha</dfn>; the sacrifice of a
horse, <dfn>Aswamédha</dfn>; that of a man, <dfn>Narmédha</dfn>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Yajna</dfn>, or “sacrifice” is to be offered in the
months of <dfn>Mágha</dfn>, “January,” <dfn>Váisháka</dfn>, “April,”
or <dfn>Márga-sirsha</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span>
“August.” Every person performs
the Yajna once; but he sacrifices a goat
every year; or, if in indigent circumstances, the
figure of a goat formed of flour; and if he be a
follower of Vishnu, the goat is to be a figure formed
of the same materials, as among that sect cruelty
towards the animal creation is reckoned as impiety.
In their Smriti, or “sacred writing,” it is thus laid
down: “Let that person put animals to death who
has the power of reanimating them, as the victim
thus sacrificed must be restored to life.” Moreover,
their pious doctors have said that, by the
sacrifice of a sheep, is meant the removal of ignorance;
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
by that of a cow, the abandoning low pursuits;
by that of the horse, the curbing of the mind;
as according to the Hindus, Manah, or “the heart,”
from which proceed all phantasies and internal
sense, is a fiery and unbroken steed; finally, shedding
man’s blood in sacrifice, implies the eradication
of all reprehensible human qualities. It is also
to be highly commended in a Brahman not to devote
himself to lucrative pursuits, but to repair to
the abode of his co-religionists, and being satisfied
and grateful for the portion of grain he receives
from them, to give up the rest of his time to devotion;
nor is he to collect so much food as to have
any remaining for the next day. Vessels of gold
are esteemed more pure than those of any other
metal. Whenever a Brahman sees an idol-temple,
a cow, or a holy personage, he is to walk reverentially
round each. He is not to perform the offices
of nature in running water, nor in a cow-shed, nor
in ashes; before a Brahman, or a cow, or in sight of
the great luminary; when he retires to any place for
this purpose, he is not in that state of nudity to look
towards the stars; neither is he to go out naked in
rain, nor sleep with his head to the west; he is not
to cast saliva, blood, nor semen into water, nor
extend his feet towards the fire for the purpose of
warming them; he is not to leap on fire, nor drink
water with both hands. It is also wrong to awake,
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
unless in case of necessity, one who is in a profound
sleep; nor is it allowed to sit on the same couch
with a sick person. It is not right to enter upon
any undertaking to which a suspicion of evil consequences
is attached. Great care must also be taken
to remove to a distance from the smoke of a dead
body on the funeral pile. No one is to return to
his home, whether in a city or village, except by
the public gate. A Brahman must not receive a
gift from a mean and sordid monarch, or from an
avaricious person of degrading pursuits, as in the
future investigation, punishment certainly awaits
such conduct: in short, he never accepts any thing
from the impure or base. He is not to look at his
wife when sneezing, yawning, or gaping; when she
is seated in privacy at her ease; or when applying
collyrium to her eyes, or anointing her hair.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span>
He ought not to sleep naked in his bed-room, nor
in an empty house without a companion; he ought
not to throw water about in play, with the palm
of his hand or with his foot, nor to blow out fire
with his breath, without using any instrument.</p>

<p>It is to be known, that the astronomers among
the Brahmans, in their computation, divide the
month into two parts; from the beginning to the
fifteenth day they reckon one part, and call the sixteenth
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
day <dfn>Púrva</dfn>, that is, one entire part; and the
rest, to the end of the month, is the other part; in
like manner, they have in each month twice twelve
and six days; which they distinguish by the denomination
<dfn>dvádásí</dfn>, “the twelfth,” and <dfn>chachtí</dfn>, “the
sixth, day” of the lunar fortnight.</p>

<p>Nobody ought to put his feet upon the shade of a
Dív, that is, of the image of a celestial being, of a
king, a preceptor, a saint, and a married wife of
another. It is not right to look with contempt
upon a Brahman. One may beat a delinquent on
account of a fault, or a pupil by way of chastisement,
but his blows must not hurt the upper parts of the
body. No man ought to dispute or wrangle with
one higher in rank than himself, nor with a widow,
nor with a man without connexion, an old woman,
a beggar, nor with children. Let him feign ignorance
with respect to a mandate upon a woman,
and towards a person who should be aware of the
bad conduct of his wife. He is never to take his
meal upon the same table-cloth with a man without
religion, a butcher, and one who sells his wife.
The master of the house ought never, with a loud
voice, to invite another to his board, because this
looks like ostentation.</p>

<p>Nine stars are to be worshipped for the increase
of wealth, the accomplishment of our wishes, and
the union with the divinity; namely, Saturn, Jupiter,
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, the solstice,
and the descending node. Let the pious distribute
to the Brahmans and to the wise men what is prescribed
of corn, raiment, and jewels that may suit
them. The king is to possess dignity, wisdom, and
affability towards young and old; he is to be just
towards the complainants; at court, condescending
to all, mild and liberal, knowing the truth, understanding
the wishes of men, respectful to the pious
and the saints, and showing deference to the lords
of the faith, and the secluded from the world; he is
to be humble and command his ambition; and in
whatever may occur, pleasure and pain, fortune and
misfortune, let his conduct never be mutable and
inconsistent.</p>

<p>Whoever runs away in battle, renders himself
highly guilty, and all the merit which he might have
acquired before, falls to the share of another who
stood firm in the field of battle.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span>
A king who, with
the laudable qualities before described, exerts himself
in the maintenance of his laws, the distribution
of justice, and the welfare of the cultivators, shares
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
the recompense of all the good actions which the
inhabitants of the country have performed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_127" id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span>
The
exercise of justice is imposed as a necessity upon a
king; in order that, if a son, brother, uncle, brother-in-law,
preceptor, or any other friend, commit a
crime, he may immediately, according to the established
code of laws, order their chastisement, terrify,
reprimand, or subject them to retaliation.</p>

<p>In the Hindu Institutes which are called <span class="title">Smriti</span>,
it is said to be established that, after the worship of
the Supreme God, they ought to venerate the subordinate
divinities, and perform the prescribed rites.
To eat flesh, and to put to death some animals, is
therein not prohibited, excepting the cow; he who
kills, or even hurts, this animal, shall never enjoy
the sight of heaven; and they say that he only who
can restore to life, may put to death, an animal; this
is necessary: who destroys a living being must vivify
it again; if he be not able to do this, he ought to
forbear from that act, because he shall not escape
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
punishment for it. According to their learned interpreters,
the killing of certain animals which is permitted
in their sacred books, signifies the eradicating
and destroying of such blameable qualities as are
proper to these animals.</p>

<p>In ancient times, it was the custom among the
Brahmans and the wise among them, when they had
become householders and begotten a son, to withdraw
from society, and when they had established
their sons, to separate from them, and having retired
into a desert, to devote themselves to the worship
of God; and when the sons had children in their
house, their father and mother did not visit each
other in the desert, but lived separate from each
other, at the distance of several farsangs.</p>

<p>The religious austerity of this people is very great;
thus they practise perpetual standing upon their
legs, hanging themselves up, abstaining from conversation,
keeping silence, cutting themselves asunder,
leaping down from a rock, and such like.
Women used to burn themselves alive with their
dead husbands: this is according to the <cite>Smriti</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span>
which is ascribed to Brahma, and believed to be
eternal truth.</p>

<p>Of this people, the author of this book saw in
Lahor, the capital of the sultan, a Brahman, called
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
Sri Manu Rama, who would not accept any nourishment
from the Musulmans, nor keep society with
strangers. It was said, that an Umra of the Mahommedans
had offered him three lacs of rupees, which
he refused to take. Pursuant to his religion, he
abstained from animal food. Kesayi Tívárí is one of
the Brahmans of Benáres, and well conversant with
the science of his class. Having left his house, he
settled on the bank of the river Ravi, which passes
near the garden Kamran, at Lahór: given up to
devotion, he seeks no protection against rain and
sun; he lives upon a little milk; and whatever he
has collcted during several months, he spends in
the entertainment of the pious Brahmans whom he
invites.</p>

and seeks purity, will ever perform his ablution with the pure part of
his hand, and with water neither hot nor frothy, standing in a lonely
place, and turning to the east or north. (62) A Brahman is purified by
water that reaches his bosom; a Chatríya, by water descending to his

 This rite is called <span class="title">Achamana</span>, performed by taking up water in the
palm of the right hand three times, and drinking it as it runs towards
the wrist; then, with the right hand, the Brahman is to touch his lips,

then sitting to the <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> or <abbr title="East">E.</abbr>, before sunrise, cleanse his teeth with

then taking up some earth in his hand and diluting it with water, put
the middle finger of his right hand in this earth, and make a line

 We read in Colebrooke’s Treatise on the Védas (<cite><abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="volume Eight page">vol. VIII.
p.</abbr> 370) what follows: “It is well known, that the original Véda is
believed by Hindus to have been revealed by Brahma, and to have
been preserved by tradition, until it was arranged in its present order
by a sage, who thence obtained the surname of <span class="title">Vyása</span>, or <span class="title">Véda Vyaśa</span>,
that is, ‘compiler of the Védas.’ He distributed the Indian scripture
into four parts, which are severally entitled <span class="title">Rich</span>, <span class="title">Yajush</span>, <span class="title">Sáman</span>,
and <span class="title">At´harvańa</span>; and each of which bears the common denomination
of Véda.”</p>

<p class="footnote">After having discussed the question whether the fourth Véda be more
modern than the other three, the celebrated Indianist concludes (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 372):
“That the three first-mentioned Védas are the three principal portions
of the Véda; that the <span class="title">At´harvańa</span> is commonly admitted as a fourth;
and that divers mythological poems, entitled <span class="title">Itihása</span> and <span class="title">Puránás</span>,
are reckoned a supplement to the scripture, and, as such, constitute a
fifth Véda.” He says further (<span class="decoration">ibid.</span>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 378): “Each Véda consists of
two parts, denominated the <span class="title">Mantras</span> and the <span class="title">Bráhmańas</span>, or ‘prayers’
and ‘precepts.’ The complete collection of the hymns, prayers,
and invocations belonging to one Véda is entitled its <span class="title">Sanhita</span>. Every
other portion of Indian scripture is included under the general head
of divinity (<span class="title">Bráhmańa</span>). This comprises precepts which inculcate
religious duties; maxims, which explain those precepts; and arguments,
which relate to theology.&mdash;The theology of the Indian scripture, comprehending
the argumentative portion entitled <span class="title">Védanta</span>, is contained
in tracts denominated <span class="title">Upanishads</span>.”&mdash;<abbr title="Anthony Troyer">A. T.</abbr></p>

<p class="footnote">The Hindus have, besides, <span class="title">Upavédas</span>. <span class="title">Upa</span> is a preposition importing
resemblance in an inferior degree; and <span class="title">Véda</span>, from <dfn>Vida</dfn>, “knowledge.”
The four Upavedas comprise the <span class="title">Ayu</span>, on the science of medicine,
drawn from the Rig Veda; the <span class="title">Gandharva</span>, on music, from the
Sama-Véda; the <span class="title">Dhanu</span>, on military tactics, from the Yajush; and the
<span class="title">Silpa</span>, on mechanics, from the Atharvańa.</p>

<p class="footnote">Hindu learning has six divisions, called <span class="title">Angas</span>, that is, “parts,” or

of the <dfn>Pisáchas</dfn> (vampires). The six first in direct order are by some
held valid in the case of a priest; the four last in that of a warrior; and
the same four, except the <span class="title">Rakshasa</span> marriage, in the cases of a merchant

 According to Mr. Wilson, it is when the bridegroom gives to the bride,
her father, and paternal relations, as much as he can afford. According
to Ward, it is when money is received in exchange for a bride. Where a
present is made to the father of the girl, the caste of the boy is not very
respectable. In the most respectable marriages, the father not only gives
his daughter without reward, but bears the expenses of the wedding,
and presents ornaments, goods, cattle, and money to the bridegroom
(<cite>Ward</cite>, <abbr title="volume Three pages">vol. III. p.</abbr> 163-168). Ward mentions eight kinds of marriage:
1. <dfn>Bráhma</dfn>, when the girl is given to a Brahman without reward; 2.
<dfn>Daíva</dfn>, when she is presented as a gift at the close of a sacrifice; 3.
<dfn>Arsha</dfn>, when two cows are received by the girl’s father; 4. <dfn>Prájápatya</dfn>,
when the girl is given at the request of a Brahman; 5. <dfn>Asura</dfn>, as above;
6. <dfn>Gandharva</dfn>; 7. <dfn>Rákshasha</dfn>; 8. <dfn>Piśhácha</dfn> (<cite>Ward, ibidem</cite>).&mdash;<abbr title="David Shea">D. S.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the fourth, of the followers of the
Vedanta (the Vedantians).</span>&mdash;This sect belongs to the
most learned and wise of this people. We shall
give the substance of their creed. They say: The
explanation regarding the only really existing Being
(God) resembles a science from which a faint likeness
of his grandeur may be perceived; this being and
his qualities are pure of all imperfections and contradictions;
he oversees all beings; he discovers all
that is hidden; his existence comprehends all things;
decay and deficiency have no access to the boundless
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
area of his existence; he is the lord of life, the greatest
of spirits endowed with pure qualities, and this holy
Being, this sublime object, they call <span class="title">Brahma uttama</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span>
“the most excellent Brahma,” that is, the supreme
soul and the most exalted spirit; and the evidence
of this meaning, that is, of his existence, is the created
world; because a creation without a creator will not
come forth from the veil of non-entity into the field
of evidence, and the maker of this work is he, the
Lord. This explanation is to be supported in the
field of certainty by the wise arguments of sagacious
people, and by the testimonies of the text of the
Véda, that is, of the heavenly book. The truly
existing Being (God) has exhibited this world and
the heavens in the field of existence, but he has nothing
like an odor of being, nor has he taken a
color of reality; and this manifestation they call
<span class="title">Máyá</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span>, that is, “the magic of God;” because the
universe is “his playful deceit,” and he is the bestower
of the imitative existence, himself the unity
of reality. With his pure substance, like an imitative
actor, he passes every moment into another
form, and having again left this, appears in another
dress. It is he alone who, coming forth in the
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
forms of Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahadeva, exhibits
the true unity in a trinity of persons, and who,
manifesting his being and unity in three persons,
separate from each other, formed this universe.
The connexion of the spirits with the holy Being
(God), is like the connexion of the billows with the
ocean, or that of sparks with fire; on that account,
they call the soul and the spirits <span class="title">jívátmá</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
The soul
is uncompounded and distinct from the body and
from the material senses; but by the power of selfishness
it fell into a captivity from which the soul
strives to be liberated.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_132" id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span>
The soul has three conditions
or states: the first is the state of being awake,
which they call <span class="title">jágaravast´ha</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_133" id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span>
and in this state the
soul enjoys quietly the pleasures of nature and bodily
delights, such as eating and drinking, and the like;
and it suffers from the privation of these just-mentioned
enjoyments; that is, it suffers from hunger
and thirst, and similar pains; the second state is
that of sleep, called <span class="title">svapna avast´ha</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span>
and in this state
the soul is happy in the possession of what it wishes
and desires, such as collecting in dreams gold and
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
silver, and similar things; it is distressed by the
want of them; the third state is known by the name
of <dfn>Su svapna avast´ha</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_135" id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span>
that is, “the state of good
sleep,” and in this state there is neither gladness
nor sadness from possession or privation of what is
desired, but freedom from pleasure and pain. It
is to be known that they hold sleep to bestow a prophetic
sight of events, and the vision is called <span class="trans">rúyá</span>
in Arabic: in this third state however, which they
call sleep by excellence, no events are seen, but it is
being plunged in a profound sleep, and this people
do not take it simply for sleep, but they distinguish
it as a sort of lethargy, which they call <span class="title">su svapna</span>.
They believe the souls to be imprisoned in these
three states, and wandering about in a circle. The
soul in these conditions, although united with a
body, yet, by a number of meritorious deeds, and a
virtuous conduct, attains to the station of knowing
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
itself and God: it then breaks the net of illusion,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_136" id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span>
and it is the characteristic of saints whom they call
<span class="title">Jnání</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_137" id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span>
that, whatever they see in the state of being
awake, they reckon to be a vain illusion, as if presenting
itself to men in a dream. The saint thinks
even a man awake to be deceived by a dream; like
one who, from inadvertency, takes a rope for a snake;
but it is a rope, not a snake: he knows the world to
be a delusion, which, from want of knowledge, is
thought to be the universe, although, in truth, it
has no reality. This state is called by them <span class="title">Tarbá
avast´há</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_138" id="fnanchor_138"></a><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>When the saint becomes free from the ties and
impediments of the world, and from the chains of
its accidents, then he enters into the region of freedom,
which they call <span class="title">mukt</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_139" id="fnanchor_139"></a><a href="#footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></span>
This mukt, according
to them, is divided into five parts: the first is, when
the sanctified man, having attained the dignity of
freedom, in the city of the subordinate divinities
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
(angels), becomes one of them; as in this city are
the residences of the deities, such as the city of
Brahma, of Vishnu, of Mahadéva, and this part is
called “the mukt of the pious.” The second part
is, when the devotee, a neighbour and companion of
the gods, is surrounded by an abundance of favor,
and the society of the celestial beings; and this
division of the mukt they call <span class="title">Svámi prémá</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_140" id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span>
The
third part is, when the pious assumes the form of
the inferior divinities without union with their persons,
that is, whichever of the gods he chooses, it is
his shape which he appropriates to himself, and this
part they name <span class="title">Sára préma</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_141" id="fnanchor_141"></a><a href="#footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span>
The fourth part of the
mukt is, when the pious becomes united with one of
the gods, like water with water, that is, when he
coalesces with whichever of the gods he chooses,
and this is entitled <span class="title">svayukti</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_142" id="fnanchor_142"></a><a href="#footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></span>
The fifth part is, when
the soul of the pious, called <span class="title">jívátma</span>, becomes one
with the great spirit whom they call <span class="title">paramátmá</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_143" id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></span>
and
recognise as the only real being, in such a manner
that there remains no room for a second to rise between,
and this they distinguish by the name of
<span class="title">Jnánam uttamam</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
This is the substance of the creed of the Védantian:
whoever possesses this science is called <span class="title">Inání</span>
by the Hindus, and all the principal men among
them are conversant with the doctrine of this sect.
The sublime discourses and wise histories delivered
by Vasishta for the instruction of Rama chandra, are
entitled <span class="title">Vasíshta yog</span>; and the speeches which fell
from the tongue of Krishna, when he was bestowing
advice upon Arjuna, who was one of the Pandus,
go under the name of <span class="title">kathá</span>. Sankara Acharya,
who ranks highest among the later learned men of
India, has written much about this doctrine. The
dogmas of this class are as follow: the world and
its inhabitants are appearances without reality, and
God is but one necessary and self-existing being,
whom they call <span class="title">Parama atma</span>; they say, this appearance
and diversity of form, this order and aspect of
heavens, are like the vapor resembling the sea upon
the surface of sandy plains, and like the vision of a
dream; good and bad, pleasure and pain, adoration
and worship of God, are but objects of imagination,
and these various images are illusions;&mdash;the deepest
pits of hell, the vaults of heaven, the return to earth
after death, transmigration, and the retribution of
actions, all that is but imagination, and variety of
imagination.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Query</span> Should one say, a principle of life acts in
us; there is no doubt of it; consequently the one
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
is learned, the other ignorant; the one is happy, the
other distressed. How can that be mere imagination,
and appearance?</p>

<p><span class="sc">The answer</span> they give to it is&mdash;If not in a dream,
thou wouldst not see thyself a king issuing mandates,
a servant, submissive, imprisoned, free, a
slave, a master, sick, healthy, distressed, merry,
melancholy, and so on. How often in a dream didst
thou not feel pleasure and happiness, or wast overwhelmed
by fear, and terror, and anguish? there is
no doubt but all this is mere illusion and empty
appearance, although the dreamer holds it all to be
real truth.</p>

<p>Rayi-Rup, who is reckoned among the learned Rajahs,
asked the author of this book: “After having
dreamt to have received any wound whatsoever
upon my body, if, as soon as I rise from sleep, I
do not find the least mark of it, I know that it
was an illusion; but if in a dream I converse with
a woman, at my waking, I may perhaps not be
able to deny the visible effect of it: why should
this happen in the second case?”</p>

<p>To this question the following answer was given:
“What thou thinkest the state of being awake, this,
in the opinion of the enlightened, is also dreaming;
and as it often happens that, thinking in a
dream to be awake, I perceive whatever appears
as if I were really awake, whilst I see it in a dream:
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
in like manner, the usual state of being awake is
held by the wise to be nothing else but a dream.
Hast thou not heard what Kámyáb Samrádí has
said in the Samrád námeh? A man had seven noble
sons, each of whom felt the ambition to command
in the six parts of the world. With such a desire,
they addressed their devotion to God. One day
they laid their head upon the pillow of repose,
and each had a bright dream. It appeared to
each, that he had left his body, and was born
again in a king’s house; after the death of the
father, each placed the crown upon his head, and
bore dominion from east to west; in the seven
regions there was no king equal to him, and the
reign of each lasted one hundred thousand years;
at the time of his passing to the other world, he
delivered the empire to his son, and, leaving the
body, took his flight to heaven. When they
awoke, the dinner which they had been preparing
was not yet ready. Afterwards, each of them
related what happened to him; each of them pretended
to have possessed the seven regions during
one hundred thousand years, and each named
such and such a town as the capital of his empire.
Although awake, they resolved then to go
each to his kingdom, and to see that capital, whether
true or not. They went first to the town
which was the residence of the eldest brother;
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
there they found his son king, and the father
knew his palace; in this manner they visited the
kingdoms of the other brothers, and saw their
sons. Afterwards, the seven returned to their
native-place, and said to each other: ‘Each of
us was in his dream king of the seven regions,
and had no other above himself; being awakened,
we heard the same from the men of those towns
which we have visited for ascertaining that we
had possessed such rank and power in the
world.’ Thus it is certain that we are even now
in a dream, and that the world is nothing else
but an illusive vision.”</p>

<p>This sect interpret the whole religion of the Hindus
according to their own belief, and they state
that, pursuant to the Védas, to confound during the
worship all the subordinate divinities with the one
whose existence is necessary, means nothing else
but that, in truth, they all emanate from this one;
further that it is but he who manifests himself in
the form of any deity, and that no <span class="title">Serosh</span> has an
existence of his own, but that in Brahma, Vishnu,
and Mahadéva, who appeared above, are evidenced
the three attributes of God, namely, in Brahma, the
creator; in Vishnu, the preserver; and in Mahadéo,
the destroyer. Moreover they say, that these three
attributes are the mind or intellect, which they call
<span class="title">manas</span>, and it is the action of the interior sense which
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
they distinguish particularly by the name of <span class="title">manas</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span>
Besides they entertain this belief about the interior
sense, that, if the mind wishes, it forms the image
of a town; it becomes then <span class="title">Brahma</span>, who has as much
as created it; as long as the mind wishes, it preserves
its work, on which account it becomes <span class="title">Vishnu</span>,
who is its guardian; further, if it wishes, it throws
it off, in which sense the mind becomes <span class="title">Mahadeo</span>.
Their belief is also, that religious austerity consists
in the conviction of the pious, that the world is an
appearance without reality, and that, what exists, is
in truth God; and that, except him, every thing is
but an illusion which comes from him, but in truth
has no reality. In their opinion, whoever is desirous
of this faith, and does not possess the required
knowledge, may by self-application, or by the lessons
of a master, or by the instruction of a book,
become a proficient in it. The conviction that the
world does not exist, may also be acquired by pious
exercise; and the perfect therein know, that by
means of religious austerity one may acquire what
he wishes to learn, and as long as he tends towards
it, he has not yet known himself, as he is himself a
choice part of the divine being. The pious man, who
by dint of austerity renders himself perfect, they call
a <span class="title">Yogí</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span>
that is, one who by self-mortification attains
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
his aim. The pious, who by mental application, by
the instruction of a master, by the study of books,
or by any effort not appertaining to religious exercises,
raises himself to any perfection, him they
name <span class="title">Rája-yogí</span>, that is, one who attains sovereignty.</p>

<span class="title">Mantra</span>
signifies prayer; <span class="title">Homa</span> is throwing clarified butter
and like things into the fire, and reciting prayers, in
order to render propitious a certain divinity; <span class="title">Dandavat</span>
is, when one prostrates himself like a stick
before the object of adoration, and touches the
ground with the forehead. A person asked Bhartari,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span>
who was one of those adepts whom they call
<span class="title">Jnánis</span>: “Dost thou recite mantras?” He replied:
“I do.” That person asked again: “What mantra?”
He answered: “My breath, going out and
in, is my mantra.” That man continued to ask:
“Dost thou perform Hóm?” The answer was:
“I do.” To the question, “And how?” the reply
followed: “By what I eat.” That person further
inquired: “Dost thou practise the Dańdavat?”
After affirmation, being asked “At what time?” he
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
said, “When I sleep, stretched out to rest.” And
this speech reminds me of this sentence:</p>

<div class="poem">

of the ignorant.”</cite></div>

<p>The Hindus call <dfn>Déva árcháká</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span>
the worshipper of
an idol, that is, one who is devoted to a divinity:
which this people interpret to be performing whatever
rite a man himself chooses; because the deity
is the intellectual soul; to render it obsequious, is
to perform the act which it commands, that is,
whenever it wills, to see with the eyes, to hear with
the ears, to smell with the nose, and so on, in order
to please one’s self. According to their account of
the revealed unity of God, all is <em>HE</em>. To say so
is liable to censure; but it is permitted to assert:
“all is <em>I</em>.” Should one not attain to this height of
philosophy, he may choose the former thesis. The
author of the <cite>Gulchén raz</cite>, “the rose-garden of mystery,”
says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i4">“Egotism belongs to God alone,</div>
 <div class="i0">For he is the mystery; think him also the hidden source of illusion.”</div>
</div>

<p>This people are masters of themselves in their
speeches and actions; they know their origin and
their end; and, occupied with themselves, they are
imprisoned in the gaol of the world. Sankara Atcharya,
who is distinguished among the Brahmans
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
and the Sanyasis, professed this doctrine, and to
whatever side he turned his face, contentment followed
him. One day the adversaries and deniers
of this creed resolved to drive an elephant against
him; if he do not fly but remain firm, he is a saint;
if otherwise, a bad man. When they had impelled
the animal against him, Sankara fled; then they said
to him: “Why didst thou fly before an illusion?”
He replied: “There is no elephant, nor I; and there
was no flight: you saw it in a dream.” All the
great men among the Hindus are of this creed, and
they agree that, in truth, there is no faith but this,
without regard to Avátars and Rakshasas: all the
enlightened Pandits have ranged themselves upon
this side.</p>

<p>A <span class="title">Jnaníndra</span> is called one of the Brahmans of Kachmir;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span>
this class is, in the language of Kachmir, entitled
<span class="title">Guruvagurinah</span>, and said to be the fathers of the
Jnanían. One whose name was Chívarína, knew
well how to keep in his breath; one day he informed
the inhabitants of Náu chaher, which is upon the
road of Kashmír, that on the morrow he intended to
leave his human frame. The next day, the people
assembled; Shívarina conversed with them until he
arrived at the place where wood had been piled up,
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
on the top of which he sat down with his legs crossed
under him (which in the Persian language is called
<span class="trans">bahín neshisten</span>, and the description of which I gave
in the chapter about the imprisonment of breath
practised by the Yezdaníán); he left then the human
body, and when the people saw that the bird of life
had taken his flight from the cage of the body, they
set the wood on fire.</p>

<p>Another Jnani practised the subduing of the breath
in his youth, and, mastering his soul by means of
religious austerity, he attained to that point that,
although possessed of little natural capacity, he
undertook to read all the books of the Hindus, and
understood all their sciences better than the other
Pandits, as they all agreed. He now holds the first
rank among the learned of his town, and acquired
such an independent manner of thinking, that he
feels neither pain from the loss, nor pleasure from
the increase, of wealth, and holds alike friend, enemy,
stranger, and relation; he is not depressed by the
insult, nor elated by the praise of whomsoever;
wherever he hears the name of a Durvísh, he calls
on him, and, if he conceives a good opinion of him,
he then frequents him and cultivates his friendship,
and never lets him be afflicted and sorrowful; he
converses about God’s unity, and cares about nothing
else nor busies himself about any other concern, and
he visits no other persons but Durvishes. Sodarshan
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
is the name of his sister’s son, who is also connected
with him as his pupil; he left wife, son, and
the house of this friend, and lives on the little which
his disciples bring to him. When the Jnaní wishes
to go out, the disciple puts his coat on him: because,
inattentive to every thing exterior and to
what may be grateful about him, he is never occupied
with any thing else but with books.</p>

<p>It is known that the Hindus, that is, the legalists
attached to the Smriti (holy scripture), light up a fire,
and with it sacrifice a sheep, not without reciting
spells and prayers; which they call performing
<span class="title">Hóm</span>. The Jnánindra says: “Our fire is piety, and
in it I burn the wood of duality; instead of a
sheep, I sacrifice egotism: this is my <span class="title">Hóm</span>.”
Thus he interprets the whole religion of the Hindus,
and a great number of men became his disciples.
He has a nephew, called <span class="title">Gangu</span>, ten years
old, and younger than Sádarshan. One day, Gangu
was crying from anger; the author of this book
said to him: “Yesterday thou saidst: ‘The world
and what it contains are but illusion;’ now, why
dost thou cry?” He replied: “If the world
is nothing, then my crying has no reality; I am
not in contradiction with myself.” So saying,
he continued to cry.</p>

<p>Jaganath, eight years old, is the son of a Jnáníndra;
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
he brought a puppy into a house where an idol
was worshipped, put him there in the idol’s place,
and drew the mark of cast on his head. The boy
was asked: “What art thou doing?” He answered:
“The stone has no life; why should you not rather
worship the puppy than this idol? Besides, each
person worships what he finds agreeable. Because
this worship is a play, I play with this dog.”
And none of the people of the house raised a hand
on account of the boy’s liberty, but uttered blessings
upon him.</p>

<p>In the year 1049 of the Hejira (1639 A. D.) the
author of these pages visited in Kachmir a Jnáníndra,
and was delighted with his society. He
called him his <dfn>atma</dfn>, that is, his “intellectual soul.”
The Jnáníndra was asked: “Who is thy disciple?”
He answered: “It is he who, having arrived to the
self-existent God, knows and sees himself to be
nothing else but God.”</p>

<p>At the time when the writer of this book was
walking with a Hindu pious man on the border of
the lake of Kashmir, a Sanyási who had pretensions
to independence, joined us. There, a meal was
brought to us, and the Sanyási eat with that pious
man. After this, he began to boast: “Hitherto I
have not eat any flesh: it is but now that I have
tasted some.” The Jnání offered a cup of wine
to him, who drank it for the sake of discarding care.
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
He then reassumed the theme of self-praise. The
pious philosopher had some bread of the bazar,
which according to the Hindu faith is still more
prohibited than wine, brought upon the table-cloth.
The Sanyási broke a bit of the bread, eat it, and
again praised himself without measure: “Now,”
said he, “am I free of all bonds.” The wise smiled,
and said: “Nothing remains but to eat cow-flesh.”
The Sanyási, as soon as he heard this, left the
company.</p>

<p>Of the distinguished disciples of the Jnáníndrás,
whom the author of this work saw, are: <span class="person">Shankar
bhat</span>, <span class="person">Kanésh bhat</span>, <span class="person">Sudarshan Kal</span>, <span class="person">Adab bhat</span>, <span class="person">Máhatápindra</span>,
and <span class="person">Avat</span>, known under the name of <span class="title">Kopál
Kúl</span>. A goldsmith asked Shankar bhat, one of the
disciples just mentioned: “Why do the Jnáníndras,
with all their pretensions to independence, still
worship idols?” Shankar said: “Why dost thou
work in gold?” The goldsmith replied: “This
is my profession for gaining my livelihood.” The
answer to this was: “And worship too is a trade
and a means to procure food.”</p>

<p>Mulla Shídáyi, a Hindu, who has a name amongst
the poets, and possessed a very impressive eloquence,
went one day with the author of this book to the
house of a Jnáníndra, and conversed with him;
he saw his disciples, and having observed the manners
of the people of the house, he was struck with
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
astonishment, and said: “My whole life passed in
devotedness to pious persons; but my eyes never
beheld such independence, and my ears never
heard any thing comparable to the speeches of
those emancipated men.”</p>

<p>Hara Ráma púrí was a Sanyási, and one of the
Jnánís possessing the perfection of independence.
When he came to Kashmír, being vexed by the
length of his hair, which was like ropes, he cut it
off, on the bank of a river near a house called Bhat
jatáyi. Sri Kant Bhat, a Pandit and Hindu judge,
saw it and said: “Whenever thou cuttest off thy
hair, thou shouldst do it in a <dfn>tirth</dfn>, that is, in ‘a
house of worship.’” Hara answered: “There
is a place in the most holy of mansions, where the
heart gets delighted, and on the spot where the
dead are burnt, all obscure points are terminated.”
In the year 1051 of the Hejira (1641
A. D.) he went to Kichtovar,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_153" id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span>
and settled in a plain
called <span class="title">chawgan</span>, where they played at ball, practised
equitation, and burnt the dead. Maha Singh, the
son of Baháder Singh, Rája of Kishtovár, became his
disciple, and by devotion he rendered himself free of
the bonds of exterior things; now he likes the society
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
of the pious; he is young and conversant with
poetry. In the year 1052 of the Hejira (1642 A. D.)
a war broke out in Kishtovar, between the Rája and
the rebels of this country. When they made resound
the drum of battle, a general carnage began
on both sides of the combatants; Hara Rámapúrí,
having got upon the top of an elevated ground, was
occupied with the sight of it, and at the uproar of
the warriors and the sound of pipes, and clarions,
and kettle-drums, he began to dance, and in the
midst of his transport his foot stumbled; he fell headlong
from the mountain, and in rolling down received
from a great stone a head-wound, of which
he died. Mirza Rafíah says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“When the darkness of my heart became enlightened by the knowledge of wisdom,</div>
 <div class="i2">Whatever speeches were proffered as her arguments,</div>
 <div class="i2">They bore upon some errors of my desires;</div>
 <div class="i0">Thus the whole road was rendered winding from my stumblings.”</div>
</div>

<p>Sathrah and Jadú were two fakírs. Sathrah drew
in Nagarikot<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span>
the mark of the cast on his forehead,
and threw the zunar on his neck; he ate however
roasted cow-flesh, with bread of the bazar, and
indulged himself in pleasure-walks. Some Hindus
arrested him by force, and brought him before the
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
judge. The judge said to him: “If thou art a
Hindu, it becomes thee not to eat cow-flesh and
bread of the bazar; and, if thou art a Muselman,
wherefore the mark of the cast and the zunar?”
The answer was: “The mark of the cast is of safran
and sandal-wood; the zunar is a woven thread;
the cow-flesh comes from grass and barley; bread
from corn, and the oven from earth and water:
if thou considerest things according to truth, thou
wilt find that all is composed of four elements,
which are neither Muselmans nor Hindus; as to
the rest, let thy commands be conformable to
law.” The judge set him at liberty. Jadú was
one of his disciples, and went to Balkh, the dome
of Islam. He appeared in the mosque with the
mark of the Hindu cast, and with the zúnar, and,
arrested, was brought before the judge, who saluted
him as a Muselman. Jadú replied: “If thou givest
me a wife and settlest me in a house, I will be a
Muselman.” The judge gave him a beautiful
widow for a wife, and Jadú, having become a
Muselman, went into her house. After the lapse of
a few days, he said to the woman: “Give me the
daughter whom thou hast had with thy late husband,
in order that I may sell her, and spend the
price that I receive for her for my subsistence.
When we shall have another child, I will dispose
of it in the same manner, by selling; for this is
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
my profession, and except this I know no trade.”
The woman dismissed him. Jadú, being at liberty,
went to Kabul;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span>
he put a feather on his head, as messengers
used to do, fastened a bell round his waist,
and, with a loose belt on his shoulder and a striped
coat, he appeared in the bazar. The messengers
arrested him, and said: “Why hast thou taken our
dress?” Jadú answered: “The crown and feather
are upon the head of the nightingale and of other
birds, and the bell hangs upon the neck of the
sheep and of the cow; reckon me too one of them.”
The messengers began to handle him roughly; Jadú
asked: “What is your desire?” They said: “Thou
art now to exercise with us the nimble pace of
a courier.” Jadú did not refuse: he ran with
them, and gained so much over them that at the
morning dawn not one of the couriers remained near
him. During seven days and nights he neither ate
nor drank any thing, practising running. Jadú
acquired the habit of religious austerity; in the
year 1052 of the Hejira (1642 A. D.), having convoked
his friends in Jelálabad,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span>
between Peshaver<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_157" id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span>
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
and Kabul, he took leave from them and resigned
his life.</p>

<p>Pertábmal Chadah (Chadah is a tribe of Kshatriyas)
is a Jnání, that is a pious man; his native
country is Síál kut; he attained to perfection in the
exercise of virtue; he is not confined to any faith or
religion; but knows that every religion is a road
leading towards God; he sees in every face a friend
revealed. One day he joined, on account of an
affair, Davárah, a man who was one of the chiefs
appointed by the government of Hargovínd, a successor
of Nanak;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_158" id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span>
he became his disciple, and declared
himself as his adherent. Davárah washed
his feet, and the water thereof was drank by all the
present followers of the faith, which they did to
every body whom they had gained over to their religion.
At last, a dispute arose between Pertábmal
and Davárah; the latter said to the other: “But yesterday
I washed thy feet (that is, made thee my
disciple), and to-day thou makest war upon me?”
Pertábmal answered: “Oh weak-minded man! the
Jats always wash my feet as thou hast done: my
own hand never touches my feet.” [The Jats are
a low class of the Hindus.]</p>

<p>It is an established custom among the followers
of Nának to present, when they pursue a desire,
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
a few direms to the chief of their master, or to
their master, and solicit his favor. Pertábmal
offered some dírems to Kábelí, who was a religious
chief appointed by Harigovind, and then in Kabul;
he said with his hands joined: “I wish to convoke
for prayer, according to their custom, all the followers
of Nának; let that be granted.” Kabeli,
before giving his agreement, asked: “Thou wishest
perhaps to see Haragovind?” Pertábmal said: “I
wish something more precious.” Kabeli asked:
“What is this?” The answer was: “I wish the
arrival of all the buffoons, dancers, and musicians
from Péshawar to Kabul, that we may see
their actions, arts, and tricks.”</p>

<p>In the house of Pertábmal was an idol which the
Hindus worship. A mouse having made a hole in
his furniture, he put the whole idol, instead of a
lump of earth, into the mouse-hole, in order to shut
the passage. The Hindus said: “What art thou
about?” He answered: “The deity who cannot
obstruct the road of a mouse, and settle any thing
with a mouse, how will he protect me, and preserve
me from the tyranny of the Muselmans?”
In like manner Pertábmal had in his house a Sivalingam,
which is a post of stone which the Hindus
venerate: having carried this lingam out of his
house, like a post, he tied a dog to it.</p>

<p>A Muselman said to him: “Two persons only of
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
all unbelievers, namely, Nushirvan and Hatam,
will go to heaven.” Pertábmal replied: “According
to your faith, two persons only of the
unbelievers will go to heaven; but our belief is
that not one of the Muselmans will go to
heaven.”</p>

<p>Azadah (this was his adopted title) is a Brahman.
One day he ate at table with some Muselmans and
drank wine. They said to him: “Thou art a Hindu,
and thou takest thy meal in common with
Muselmans? Your people never eat but with
persons of their religion.” Azádah replied: “I
did not suppose that you were Muselmans; hereafter
I will at eating and drinking keep myself
separate from you.” Another day he found himself
again drinking wine in company with them,
and did not turn his head from the meal; during
the repast they said to Azádah: “Yesterday we
made ourselves known to thee as Muselmans.”
He answered: “I knew that you were joking with
me. God forbid that you should be Muselmans.”</p>

<p>Binaváli is the son of Híráman, a Káyastha.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_159" id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span>
The
Káyasthas are a tribe of the fourth cast which Brahma

was Walí;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_160" id="fnanchor_160"></a><a href="#footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span>
from his childhood he liked very much the
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">115</span>
society of durvishes; and in his tender age he was
with the religious chief, named Ularváh, a great durvish,
whose continual exclamation was: “God, thou
art present, thou art one, God, I attest this.” In
the year of the Hejirah 1045 (A. D. 1634) he associated
with the durvishes of India, and enjoyed the fruit of
it; he came to Kashmir in the service of Mulla Shah
Budakhshí, and acquired the desired knowledge.
The Sufí is by no necessity bound to a creed; no faith
nor religion fetters his choice; he befriends the idol
and the temple of the idol, and is no stranger to the
mosque; by the power of ecstacy, not by any external
knowledge, he utters loud sublime speeches.
In the year 1050 of the Hejira (1640 A. D.) the doors
of friendship opened between him and the author of
this work; from the refulgencies of his mind are
the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Azadah and Binaválí appear in the dress of Hindus,
and profess the belief of the Jnánís, to which
they are reckoned to belong.</p>

<p>Mehir chand is a native of the Panjab, and belongs
to the class of the goldsmiths of Guzerat; he comes
from the school of the disciples of Akamnath, whose
opinions he adopted. Akamnath is a Yógí, “a
saint,” and possessed of inspiration; according to
the belief of his followers, two thousand years of
his life have elapsed.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i2">“Like the azure heavens, a sage never dies;</div>
 <div class="i0">The intellectual principle is free from storms, and from all that is perishable.”</div>
</div>

<p>One day Akamnath came before the great emperor
Jehangír, who is in heaven; the celebrated
monarch asked him: “What is thy name?” The
sage answered <dfn>Sarvat anga</dfn>, that is, “All the beings
are my members.” In the assembly, before the
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
sovereign, a book was read; the king, having taken
the book from the reader, gave it into the hand of
Akamnath, saying: “This is thy saying, read it;”
Akamnath returned the book to the reader, bidding
him to read on; but when this man began, the king
addressed Akamnath: “To thee have I said, read.”
His answer was: “I have at the beginning declared,
that all things in the world are my members;
I am therefore reading by the tongue of
that man.” Vásúl Khaznúyi says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“So free is my spirit that the creation is my body,</div>
 <div class="i0">And that fire, and air, and earth, are my dwelling.</div>
 <div class="i0">This celestial sphere, with all its globes,</div>
 <div class="i0">Revolves only because it is my wish.”</div>
</div>

<p>Soon after a sparrow passed, flying from the
water. Akamnath declared before the king: “If
with this body, which is near thy majesty, I
should attempt to go upon the water, I could
but sink, but under the form of a bird I passed.”
The great Mouláná Jamí says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“The world, with all spirits and bodies,</div>
 <div class="i0">Is a certain person whose name is ‘<span class="title">World</span>.’”</div>
</div>

<p>They say, that Akamnath went to the Kâbah (of
Mecca) and saw the house; he asked somebody:
“Where is the master of the house?” That person
remained astonished. They opened the door
of the house of God; Akamnath repeated the question
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
without receiving an answer from them; he then
called out: “There is no master of the house in
this edifice: this place is unsafe.” Finally, he inquired
from the people, why the images which had
been in this house, have been thrown out; one
answered: “Because an idol is the work of the
hand of a man; and because the forms of men,
who are created, ought not to be worshipped.”
Akamnath observed: “This house, too, is the
work of men, and any form therein is that of a
man, and the work of men who are created;
should it be worshipped?” Having heard this
speech, they imprisoned him; but the next morning
they found no prisoner: Akamnath was gone. At
last, those who returned from the pilgrimage saw
him in Hindostan.</p>

death; and for a fifth, that of trance, swoon, or stupor, which is intermediate
between profound sleep and death (as it were half-dead), as
dreaming is between waking and profound sleep. In that middle

to this learned Indianist (see preface to the text, <abbr title="pages ten eleven">pp. x. xi</abbr>) Wáli was born
in Surat; he wrote about the middle of the 18th century, and was known
in India, Iran, and Turan. Is he the same with the above mentioned
Wáli? So much only can be said, till better informed, that the ono was a
contemporary of the other.</p>

<dfn>Avidya</dfn> signifies with them that they believe the body
and the senses to be the soul; <dfn>avidya</dfn> knows of no
beginning nor origin; <dfn>ishmata</dfn> means personality,
individuality, and selfishness; <dfn>rága</dfn> is the propensity
to what is agreeable; <dfn>dvésha</dfn>, “hatred,” consists in
adhering to one’s own opinion, and condemning
that of others as vicious; <dfn>avivèchaná</dfn> relates to acting
or not acting with passion. The five failings just
enumerated keep <dfn>Purusha</dfn>, “the embodied soul,” in
distress: but when the mind becomes pure, these
five pains are banished. After the purification of
the heart, all the qualities which are bad and wicked
acquire purity, and the qualities, called by them

<span class="title">vrittaya</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_170" id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span>
are of four different kinds: the first, <span class="title">mitrata</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_171" id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span>

fourth <span class="title">upèkshá</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span>
<dfn>Mitrata</dfn> is friendship for the well
doers, and benevolence for the men of probity;
<dfn>karuna</dfn> means to be anxious for the good of the
friendly-minded, and to relieve the oppressed; <dfn>mada</dfn>
consists in enjoying the quiet happiness of all the
creatures of God; <dfn>upèksha</dfn> signifies, not to use harsh
words against those who do ill. These are called
<dfn>chatur vrittayá</dfn>, or “four qualities,” which keep the
heart under subjection, and prevent it from seeing
any thing else; and it is from the existence of these
four manners that the five pains before mentioned
are annihilated, as well as every thing that attracts
them, and the fortunate man who is liberated from
these five sicknesses, attains the <span class="title">satya loka</span>. And
thus is interpreted the appearance of the forms of
Prakrit and Purusha in the heart; the professor of
this condition knows how to separate them from
each other, and becomes wise: by this knowledge
Prakrit disappears, after which, having found Purusha,
or the true knowledge of himself, which is
understood of the soul, man becomes satisfied and
happy. According to the opinion of this sect, the
five elements are deduced from Prakrit.</p>

 A system of philosophy, in which precision of reckoning is observed
in the enumeration of its principles, is denominated <dfn>Sánk’hyá</dfn>; a term
which has been understood to signify <dfn>numeral</dfn>, agreeably to the usual
acceptation of <dfn>Sánk’hyá</dfn>, “number:” and hence its analogy to the
Pythagorean philosophy has been presumed. But the name may be taken
to imply that its doctrine is founded in the exercise of judgment; for the
word from which it is derived signifies “reasoning,” or “deliberation;”
and that interpretation of its import is countenanced by a passage of the
<cite>Bhárata</cite>, where it is said of this sect of philosophers: “They exercise
judgment (<cite>Sánk’hyá</cite>), and discuss nature and other twenty-four principles,
and therefore are called <span class="title">Sánk’hyá</span>” (<cite>Colebrooke on the Philosophy
of the Hindus</cite>)&mdash;(<abbr title="Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, volume One"><cite>Transact. of the R. A. Soc. of Great Br. and

 <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">प्रकृत्ति</span> <dfn>Prakritti</dfn> is a word of the highest import with the Hindu
philosophers. In its precise sense, it means “that which is primary,”
“that which precedes what is made;” from <dfn>pra</dfn>, “before,” and <dfn>kri</dfn>, “to
make.” The Prakritti of the Sánk’hyás is a primary, subtile, universal
substance, undergoing modification through its own energy, and
for a special motive, by which it is manifest as an individual and formal
substance, varied according to the predominance of qualities which are
equipoised and inert in the parent, and unequal and active in the progeny
(see <cite>Sánk’hyá Kárika</cite>, translated by Colebrooke, commented by
Profess. Wilson, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 80-83). The author of The Dabistán in the above
passage attributes to <span class="title">Prakritti</span> the meaning belonging to <dfn>máyá</dfn>, “illusion.”
The <span class="title">Sánk’hyás</span> do not commonly confound the signification of
these two words, for they maintain the reality of existing things: but the
<span class="title">Vedantis</span> and the <span class="title">Pauranikas</span> (or followers of the Puranas) regard creation
as a delusion, or as a sport of the creator, that is, as the <dfn>máyá</dfn>.
Prakritti is translated by Colebrooke “nature,” sometimes “matter.”
Professor Lassen renders this word by “procreatrix.”</p>

 This account of the Sánkhyá philosophy will appear very incomplete
as to the whole, and incorrect in the few particulars given. I shall
enumerate the principal categories of this philosophy, which are, with
little variation, adopted by all the schools of Hindu philosophy, and
perpetually alluded to.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the sixth: on the Jogís and their doctrines.</span>&mdash;This
sect believe that <dfn>Isvára</dfn>, or the necessary
being exists, one, the principle of intellect,
without an equal, without decrease nor increase.
In the language of the Hindus <dfn>Is a</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_176" id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span>
signifies “lord,”
and without Iśa all is but <dfn>jíva</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_177" id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span>
that is “casualties;”
in their language <dfn>jiva</dfn> means “life;” they hold Is a
to be the maker of the whole world, and the creator
of all the elements; his holy being is free from care,
sickness, and want, and placed out of the circle of
work and agency; that is, that this holy being neither
wants nor urges any religious rites, such as
ablution and the like; his knowledge soars above and
comprehends all being; he is the Lord, and none
besides him invested with supreme power; death
and pain never approach his existence, which has
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
no limits. <dfn>Jíva</dfn>, “life,” they call what is in the
fetters of cares, in the bonds of infirmities, under
the pressure of pain, and in the prison of works
and doings, and subjected to the control of others,
without command over itself. This life is in truth
not material nor corporeal; it is by ignorance only
that it is thought to be one with the body; and the
body is supposed by them to be revolving in the
circle of material forms: by the necessity of times
and seasons, life abandons the works of the body,
and passes into another frame: and in this manner
it migrates. Without the <dfn>abhásayóga</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_178" id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span>
the soul
cannot be freed of the bonds of the material world,
and from the prison of what is corporeal, and <dfn>yóga</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_179" id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span>
in the language of the learned Hindus, signifies
“union,” or “acquisition;” and <dfn>abhyása</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_180" id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span>
“the
dominion of the eternal sphere,” that is, possessing
the enjoyment of a desired object; and the purport
of the <dfn>yóga</dfn> is, that the heart be constantly kept
in the remembrance of God, and that no foreign
object be permitted to enter into that Jerusalem, that
is, the house of God. The professor of this union
with the desired object reckons eight parts, which
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
are: 1. <span class="title">yama</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_181" id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span>
2. <span class="title">niyáma</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_182" id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span>

Yama is composed of five parts: the first
is <span class="title">Ahinsá</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span>
that is, doing injury to nothing, and to
kill no other but the great wild beasts; 2. <span class="title">Satyam</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span>
or “truth;” 3. <span class="title">Astéyam</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span>
that is, not stealing nor
robbing; 4. <span class="title">Brahma tchárí</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span>
or to keep away from
women, and all intercourse with them, and to sleep
upon the bare ground; 5. <span class="title">Apragraha</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span>
which is, not
to ask any thing from any body, and never to take
but what is brought unasked. <span class="title">Niyáma</span>, the second
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
of the eight parts, is divided also into five kinds:
the first, <dfn>tápasa</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span>
that is, “devout austerity;” 2.
<dfn>japa</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span>
or “devotion by means of beads, stripes of
cloth, ejaculations, mental or loud repetition of the
names and attributes of God;” 3. <dfn>Sama</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span>
which
is, “tranquillity and satisfaction;” 4. <dfn>Suchi</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span>
or
“purity, sanctity, perfection;” 5. <dfn>Iśa-pútcha</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_198" id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span>
“worshipping and praising God.” <dfn>Asana</dfn>, the third
of the eight parts of the yoga, means “sitting in
some particular posture,” various kinds of which
are used among them. <dfn>Pránáyama</dfn>, the fourth part,
consists in “drawing in and letting out the breath,
according to an established mode and fixed rule.”
<dfn>Pratyá hára</dfn>, the fifth part, signifies “withdrawing
the heart from all the desires and attractions of
the five senses; and keeping away from all sorts
of lust, the sight of beauty, the odor of the rose
and of sandal, and from all material and exterior
enjoyments.” <dfn>Dhárana</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_199" id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span>
the sixth part, implies
that, “in the heart of the cone-bearing tree, which
is the centre of the bosom, and which the people
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
of India have compared to the flower of a pond
(<dfn>lotus</dfn>), the heart holds a fixed habitation; that is,
they guard it in that place.”</p>

<p><dfn>Dhyána</dfn>, the seventh part, is the remembrance of
God the Almighty. <dfn>Samadhárana</dfn>, the eighth part,
signifies that the heart, attached to the work of God,
forgets the work of the world, in such a manner
that in his presence, turned towards him, it remains
absorbed in him, and feels itself lightened of all
exterior sense and satisfied. The wise, who carries
these eight parts to a high degree of perfection,
hears and sees from afar; his pure knowledge elevates
him; and he becomes strong in the science of
Yog, which is the science of the union with the
desired object; the all-bounteous God regards him
with pity, and discards all pains, all sicknesses, all
wants, and all deficiencies from his existence. According
to this sect, it is by attaining to these eight
conditions, that <dfn>Mukt</dfn>, which signifies “emancipation,”
is acquired.</p>

<p>This is the substance of the doctrine of the Yogís;
now, I will relate something of the opinions and
actions of these sectaries, who have been noticed in
this time as professing the doctrine of the <dfn>Yog</dfn>. The
Yogís are a class well known in India, and <dfn>yóga</dfn>, in
the Sanskrit language, means “union;” they believe
that they unite with God, whom they call <span class="title">Alíka</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span>
and
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
according to their creed he is the divinity by excellence;
moreover his being is to be venerated under
the name of <span class="title">Gorakhnáth</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span>
in like manner, <dfn>Mach’henáernáth</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span>
and <dfn>Chórengínáth</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_203" id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span>
are great personages or
saints.</p>

<p>They believe Brahma, Vichnu, and Mahadeva to be
subordinate divinities, but they are, as followers and
disciples, addicted to Gorakhnath; thus, some devote
themselves to the one or the other of the deities.</p>

<p>This sect is divided into twelve classes, which are
as follow:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_204" id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span>
<dfn>Satyanath</dfn>, <dfn>Ayípanthi</dfn>, <dfn>Kaśyapa</dfn>, <dfn>Vairag</dfn>,
<dfn>Nátírí</dfn>, <dfn>Ardhanarí</dfn>, <dfn>Náyari</dfn>, <dfn>Amara nath</dfn>, <dfn>Kam-híbdás</dfn>,
<dfn>Jóli handi</dfn>, <dfn>Tarnaknath</dfn>, <dfn>Jágar prarág</dfn>: these are called
panthi nék, “good sects,” and <dfn>panthi</dfn> signifies “a tribe,
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
a sect.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_205" id="fnanchor_205"></a><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span>
According to their opinion, the chiefs of
all religions, sects, and creeds proceed as disciples
from the prophet and saint Gorakhnath, and what
they found, they have found it from him. Their
belief is that Muhammed (to whom be peace) was
also a pupil and disciple of Gorakhnath, but, from
fear of the Muselmans, they dare not declare it;
they say, that Bábá Rin Háji, that is, Gorakhnath,
was the foster-father of the prophet, who, having
received the august mission, took the mode of Yog
from the sublime road of true faith; and a great
many of them agree with the Muselmans in fasting
and in prayers, and perform several acts according
to the religion of that people. The sect of Yogís
know no prohibited food; they eat pork as the
Hindus and the Naźárains, and cow-flesh, like the
Muselmans, and so on; they also kill and eat men,
according to the custom of the Akmían, as will be
related hereafter; and they drink wine like the Guébers.
There are some of this sect, who, having
mixed their excretions and filtered them through a
piece of cloth, drink them and say, that such an act
renders a man capable of great affairs, and they pretend
to know strange things. They call the performer
of this act <dfn>Atílía</dfn> and also <dfn>Akhórí</dfn>. Although
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
they have all originated from Gorakhnath, and adhere
to him in the generality of their faith, yet some follow
the road of those who attached themselves to the
twelve divisions of the Yoga.</p>

<p>Among them, the restraining of the breath is held
in great esteem, such as it was practised among the
Parsian by Azar Hushang, and by the kings of that
people. It is stated in the Bastán namah, that Afrasíab,
the son of Pashang, was strong in restraining
his breath, and it was on account of this qualification
that, when he had escaped from the sling of
Aâbid, he kept himself concealed in the water. This
history is known.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_206" id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span>
Among the Hindus and the
Parsian Yezdanián, nothing is esteemed higher than
this. I have said something of this custom in the
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
article upon the Parsian Sipasían: in this place I
shall state more of it.</p>

<p>This science of the breath is an imaginary one.
The Yogis, the Sanyásies, the Hindus, and the
Tapasís, say that, when one has the intention of
mastering his breath, he most strictly abstains from
intercourse with women, from eating salt and any
thing bitter and sour, as well as from toil; then,
tending towards this purpose, he will know that
from the place of sitting to the summit of the head
there are seven divisions of the body, which the
Azarián call <dfn>haft khán amèkhi</dfn>, “the seven places of
union,” and the Yogís, <dfn>sapta chakra</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_207" id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span>
“seven circles.”
The first is the region about the pubis,
similar to a flower with four leaves; the Hindus call
it <dfn>muládhára</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_208" id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span>
In the middle of this originates a
member, which the Hindus call <dfn>manthar</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span>
and the
Arabians <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">ذكر</span> <dfn>zicker</dfn>, and this is the second region.
The third is the navel, from the centre of which proceeds
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
a fire-colored vein, entitled by the Hindus
<dfn>nábhi chakra</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span>
The fourth region is that of the heart,
called by the Hindus <dfn>manipuram</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>
and that is like a
flower with twelve leaves. The fifth is the windpipe,
in the language of the Hindus <dfn>kant´a</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span>
The
sixth comprehends the interval between the two
eyebrows, in Sanskrit <dfn>bhruva</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span>
The seventh region
is that of the head, which is called by the Hindus
<dfn>brahmanda</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span>
It is to be known that in these regions
there are many veins, among which three, as the
principal, are to be distinguished: the one is on
the right side, “the solar vein;” the other in the
middle, “the earthen;” the third on the left side,
“the lunar;” these veins are named in the language
of the Hindus <dfn>áditya</dfn>, <dfn>pankila</dfn>, and <dfn>somana</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span>
in the
Persian language, <dfn>mahna</dfn>, <dfn>míná</dfn>, and <dfn>máná</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_216" id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span>
One
of the three veins is the greatest, that, namely, which
running from the middle of the back to the right of
the back bone, divides beyond it into two branches,
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
the one of which attains to the right, the other to
the left of the nostrils; the breath and the wind comes
from them, and the air which proceeds from these
veins extends, during a man’s being awake, to twelve,
during sleep to thirty-two, and during coition to
sixty-four fingers: this air and breath they hold to
be the foundation of life, and a great importance is
attached to this subject by the learned Sipásian and
Hindus. They believe the wind to be of ten kinds;
but what according to them is essential to know, is
the superior and inferior winds, which by the Hindus
are called <dfn>Prána</dfn> and <dfn>Apána</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span>
by the Persians,
<dfn>Alayi</dfn> and <dfn>Pásáyi</dfn>. These two winds attract each
other mutually, and in pronouncing “<dfn>han</dfn>,” the
breath goes out, in pronouncing “<dfn>sa</dfn>,” it goes within;
and this takes place during prayers, without the aid
and the motion of the tongue; when they fix upon a
name, it becomes <dfn>hansa</dfn>, and they say also <dfn>hamsa</dfn>:
the Hindus call it <dfn>ajapa</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span>
that is, it is pronounced
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
without the aid of the tongue; and in Persian it has
the name of <dfn>damáníbád</dfn>, or “sound of the wind.”
Thus there is, above the channel of the region of the
pubis, a most subtile vein; from the summit of the
shank a flower, bright and similar to gold in
redness, expands itself from eight roots, and after
having from this origin raised its head, and taken
the high direction to the top of the head, it is there
closed: this the Hindus call <dfn>Kundelí</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span>
“a snake;”
and the Persians <dfn>Ruhen mar</dfn>, and <dfn>Ráushibár</dfn>: and
the path of the vein of the head is a middle one.
When the Kundeli awakes to draw breath from a
high feeling, it rises to the summit of the head; in
like manner as a thread passes through the eye of a
needle, it goes through the said opening to the top
of the head. If thou knowest this mode well, thou
understandest the modes of sitting; of these we
mentioned one in the section upon the Sipasián; in
this place we shall give a further account of this
subject. The most approved mode of sitting is that
which in the Hindu language is called <dfn>Maha ásana</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span>
and <dfn>Sáda ásana</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span>
that is “sitting as the High, the
mature of age, and the accomplished,” which in
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
Persian is termed <dfn>sánishín</dfn>. The mode of this is as
follows: the heel of the left foot is placed at the orifice
of the anus, and the heel of the other foot raised
up straight to the pubis, and to the bust; the eyes,
without twinkling, are directed to the middle of the
eyebrows, then the part about the pubis is put in
motion; the inferior wind is drawn with the superior
towards the upper parts, and raised by degrees until
it reaches the head. We have explained the mode
of drawing up the breath in the section upon the
Sipasían. At the time of drawing it up, the beginning
is made on the side of the left, for emission
through the right, of the nostrils; when drawn up
on the right it is also passing through the right, and
the inferior wind emitted: this performance is called
<dfn>Pránáyama</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span>
by the Hindus, and <dfn>Aferasdam</dfn>, that is,
“raising of the breath,” by the Persians. The
devotee, on drawing up the breath at the left side,
forms the image of the moon; that is, he places the
disk of the moon to the left, and to the right that of
the sun. Some of the Sipásian place the image of
one of the seven planets at every stage of their devotion.
This mode is held in great esteem among the
Hindus at all prayers and religious exercises; they
say, the adept in it has the power of flying; he never
falls sick, is exempt from death, and from hunger
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
and thirst; it is stated in the Ramzsitán of the Persian,
that by means of this power Kái Khusro is
still alive. The Sipásían and the historians relate,
that whoever carries this process to perfection, rises
above death; as long as he remains in the body, he
can put it off and be again reunited to it; he never
suffers from sickness, and is fit for all business.
They say that Kaí Khusró, when he had acquired
perfection in this devotion, felt his heart estranged
from existence in this world; he chose retirement
from men, and having separated from this body,
he associated with the incorporeal beings, and
found eternal life. The Hindus hold that, whenever
a man has perfected himself in this act, Brahma,
Vichnu, and Mahadéva have no command over him,
but he rules over them. According to a great number
of the Hindus, it is this perfection which is personified
in the three deities, namely, Brahma, Vichnu,
and Mahadéva; and it is the belief of many,
that whoever becomes master of this process of
devotion, coalesces with God himself. Much has
been said and written upon this subject by the
Hindus and by the Persians. The Sipásíans have a
book entitled <span class="title">Sányal</span>, which contains a great deal
on this subject, and there exists no better book
about it. Other writings are those of Zardúsht, as
well as the <cite>Sarud i-mastan</cite>, and the like, in great numbers,
which I have seen. Among the Hindus similar
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
works abound, such as that composed by <span class="person">Atmá
Ráma</span>, a Yogí, who is known under the name of
<span class="title">Bahet Barváng</span>, and the book of Gorakh Singh, which
has been composed by Gorakhnath, and that of <span class="title">Ambaret
Kant</span>. The author of the Dabistán says: “I
saw Ambaret Kant, who has also translated his
work into Persian, under the title <cite>Huz ul Hayat</cite>.
Therein are the sayings of Gorakhnath, supposed
to proceed from the prophet Khizar, and Machinder
Yónas; but these speeches, pursuant to Ambarat
Kant, are not original; they are in fact those
of Gorakhnath; as, according to the Yogís, Brahma
came and went some hundred thousand times, but
Gorakhnath remained.” Relatively to the Yoga,
this book gives no further explanation.</p>

<p>Balik Nátha, they say, a penitent, was of royal
extraction, and attained great perfection in the Yoga;
he restrained his breath during one week, and
after having passed one hundred and twenty years
of his life, he had not lost his strength. I have
heard from the Mobéd Hushíar, the author of several
books, that in the year 1028 of the Hejira
(1618 A. D.), he brought me to him, and requested
him to bless me; Balik nath pronounced then
upon me: “This boy shall acquire the knowledge
of God.”</p>

<p>Serud nath, descending from Humayún, was of a
noble origin. Having in his youth attained to the
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
mastership of that sect, he could restrain his breath
for two days. In the year 1048 of the Hejira
(1638 A. D.), the author of this work saw him in
Lahore.</p>

<p>Sanjá náth, of the sect of Ayí, was a man accomplished
in restraining the breath; the people numbered
him among the saints, and said, that seven
hundred years of his life had elapsed without his
hair having yet become white: he was, in the last
mentioned year, seen in Lahore.</p>

<p>Súraj nath made great proficiency in mastering the
breath; for several years, he has chosen his retirement
in Pesháver, and is occupied with his own
concern. The people think his age scarce less than
that just before stated. The writer of this work
visited him in the year 1055 of the Hejira (1645 A. D.),
and saw several of the Yogies, an account of whom
cannot find place in this book.</p>

<p>It is an established custom among the Yogís that,
when malady overpowers them, they bury themselves
alive. They are wont also, with open eyes, to
force their looks towards the middle of their eyebrows,
until so looking they perceive the figure of a
man; if this should appear without hands, feet, or
any member, for each case they have determined
that the boundaries of their existence would be within
so many years, months, or days. When they see
the figure without a head, they know that there certainly
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
remains very little of their life; on that account,
having seen the prognostic, they bury themselves.
However the Jnánís of India hold this figure to be
an illusion, and an appearance without a trace of
reality.</p>

<p>As the Sanyásis are also pious men, I will join an
account of them to that of the Yogís. The Sanyásis
make choice of abnegation and solitude; they
renounce all bodily enjoyments; some, in order that
they may not be invested with another body, and
migrate from body to body; a great number, in
order to go to heaven; and a multitude, in order to
acquire dominion, that is, to become kings, or very
rich men. When a man becomes a Sanyási, he must
give up all desire to return again into the world.
They are distinguished by names, and divided into
ten classes, namely: <span class="title">Ban</span>, <span class="title">Áran</span>, <span class="title">Tírthah</span>, <span class="title">Áshram</span>,
<span class="title">Kar</span>, <span class="title">Parbatah</span>, <span class="title">Sákar</span>, <span class="title">Bhárthy</span>, <span class="title">Perí</span>, and <span class="title">Sarsatí</span>.
They are frequently holy men, and abstain from
eating flesh, and renounce all intercourse with
women. This class follow the dictates of Datáteri,
whom they also venerate as a deity, and say that he
is an incarnation of Naráyan, and in the retaining of
breath attained to such a degree that he is exempted
from death. When he came into the presence of
Gorakhnath, who is the chief of the Yogís, and
according to the opinion of the Sanyásis, an incarnation
of Mahádéo, Datáterí, for the sake of trial,
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
smote Gorakhnath on the head, who took the appearance
of iron. Datáteri told him: “Thou hast not
done well; there is no striking iron.” When
Gorakhnath himself bade him to combat, Datáteri
glided off from the body, in the same manner as
water glides off, and reunited safely again. In this
sense Śabur Mashedi says:</p>

<p class="center small"><cite>“The whole body became water, withhold thy hand from killing me,<br />
 As often as thou strikest a blow, my body reunites.”</cite></p>

<p>Afterwards, Gorakhnath disappeared in the water;
Datáteri, having found and recognised him in the
shape of a frog, brought him forth. When Datáteri
concealed himself in the water, Gorakhnath, in spite
of all his searching, could not succeed in discovering
him, because he was mixed with the water, and
water cannot be distinguished from water. Mirzá
Baki Alí says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“When a drop is united with the sea, it becomes sea,</div>
 <div class="i0">In substance, the bubble and billow are water: solve this riddle.”</div>
</div>

<p>Another says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“From apprehension I became water: it is useless to strike water:</div>
 <div class="i0">I am astonished that he assailed my fortune.”</div>
</div>

<p>There are two classes of Sanyásis: the one, the
<dfn>Dandaheri</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_223" id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span>
do not wear long hair, and are attached
to the precepts and regulations of the <dfn>smriti</dfn>, or of
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
the law: the second are the <dfn>Avadhútas</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_224" id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span>
they are like
the other class; they wear the zunar, and drink water
mixed with ashes; but, contrary to the Dandahar,
they let their hair grow so that it becomes like
ropes, and this they call <span class="title">juta</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span>
they do not bathe
every day, and rub their head and body with ashes,
which they call <span class="title">bhabút</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_226" id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span>
at the time of death, the
two classes, having tied the body in a bag full of
salt, throw it into the water, where, by its weight
and that attached to it, it remains a few days sunk in
the bottom, until they bury it in the earth.</p>

<p>The head of the second class is Sankara acharya;
Saha dèva, the rája of Kachmir, who in the year
750 of the Hejira (1349 A. D.) pulled off the garment
of the world, chose him for his teacher. Sankara
acharya was a learned Brahman, of a very
independent mind; the Hindus say that when the
learned did not understand the Vedanta-śastra,
Mahádéva, having incarnated himself, appeared in
the shape of Sankara acharya, for the purpose of
interpreting the Vedanta doctrine, upon which subject
many books have been written. <dfn>Sastra</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_227" id="fnanchor_227"></a><a href="#footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span>
signifies,
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
in the Sankrit language, “science,” and <dfn>Véda</dfn>,
the “heavenly book,” as has been said; <dfn>anta</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>
is
“end, the accomplishment;” that is, “the accomplishment
of the intended object;” and the intent
of the Veda is the knowledge of God and of one’s
self. On that account this science, which consists
in the knowledge of the union of God, as it is to be
derived from the text of the Veda, has been entitled
<dfn>Veda-anta</dfn>, “the accomplishment of the Veda.”
Sankara acharya was a <dfn>Jnáni</dfn>, “a saint, a divine,”
professing the unity of God; his speeches and actions
became the code of the Jnánis.</p>

<p>One of these, called <span class="title">Chatúr Vapah</span>, belongs to the
class of the <span class="title">Dandahars</span>; he descends from the Brahmans
of Guzerat, whom they call <span class="title">Nága-Brahmans</span>;
his father, of the order of jewellers, enjoyed great
consideration and opulence. Chatúr Vapah, having
acquired great perfection in the worship of God,
abandoned wife, father, mother, and children; and
chose the condition of a Sanyási; he devoted himself
to the practice of restraining the breath, and at last
attained great reputation, but never relaxed in his
religious austerity; he ate no more than three handsful;
they say that sometimes he tasted nothing but
salt, and contented himself with three pinches of it;
the nature of his manners is so well known among
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
the Sanyásis, that it is not required to say more of
it in this book. They say besides that, on account
of his perseverance in the beforesaid practice, and
on hearing the voice of God, a sound similar to that
of a harp issued from his veins. A Durvish, native
of Persia, gave the following information: “In the
year 1045 of the Hejira (1635 A. D.), one night
Chatur Vapah came to me, and said: ‘Rise, that
we may take a walk together;’ I went with him
and arrived at a deep water. Chatur Vapah,
having put his feet upon the surface of the water,
walked upon it so as not to raise a sprinkling;
he then called me; going along the border of the
pond, I joined him, who until my arrival awaited
me upon an elevated block of stone which was
near the pond. When I had seated myself near
him, he pointed to the block, and said: ‘Dost
thou guess whose work this is?’ Having considered
the bulk of the stone, which was not less
than ten cubits in length, I was struck with astonishment,
and said: ‘This may be the work of a
deity.’ Chatur Vapah replied: ‘One of my friends
dwelt here, and endeavored to shape this block
into his habitation, and having brought the huge
stone upon his shoulder from the high mountain,
began to work it. The people, astonished at
the bulk of the stone, sat down at night in a
lurking-place, so that they saw the Sanyásí with
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
the great stone on his shoulder. On that account
they represented to him: What is the reason of
undergoing such labour? Command, and we
will bring the stone down from the mountain,
and shape it right, provided the block be not
too large. The Sanyási got angry, and left the
village.’ Chatúr Vapah afterwards added: ‘Rise,
and let us go to see him:’ we went there. Sitting
cross-legged, he was occupied with himself. Chatúr
Vapah said to him: ‘This Durvish is my
friend; call the musician.’ He replied: ‘Raise
thou the light up.’ At these words, Chatur Vapah
directed his looks to the field, and an immense
torch burst forth, lighted from the mysterious
region, and threw its scattered refulgence wide
about, and the sound of many musical instruments
came upon the ear. At day-break we took leave
of him, and returned by the road which we came
to our resting place.” Khája Hafiz says right:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0">“When the chief of the wine-cellar became my preceptor, what disparity is there in it?</div>
 <div class="i2">There is no place which is not the place of God.</div>
 <div class="i2">In the cell of the hermit, in the circle of the Sufís,</div>
 <div class="i2">There is no principal place of the worshipper but</div>
 <div class="i2">The extremity of the arch of thy two eyebrows.”</div>
</div>

<p>The Hakim Kamrán of Shíraz says: “We were
in Benares with Chatúr Vapah. One of the principal
Muselmans who visited him asked him:
‘What dost thou say of the truth of our prophet?’
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
He answered: ‘You say that he is a legate of God,
and a leader of the way to the people to which the
King of truth has sent him; but it is not becoming
for those who are companions of the Monarch
of the world to take orders from him.’” The
inhabitant of heaven, Nuraddin Jehangír (may the
light of God illume his grave!) believed and placed a
suitable confidence in him. Abdár rahim of the
Khánkhan prostrated himself before him. In the
year 1033 of the Hejira (1623 A. D.), the author of
this work, then in his infancy, came with his friends
and relations from Patna to the capital, Akbár abad,
and was brought in the arms of the Mobéd Hushíar,
the odor of whose excellent qualities is diffused
about, to Chatur Vapah. The pious man rejoiced
at it, and bestowed his blessing on me, the writer
of this work; he taught me the mantra of <dfn>Súrya</dfn>,
that is, of the sun; he then enjoined Ganéśa-man,
one of his disciples who were present on this day,
that he should remain with me until the age of
manhood, when I should be able to manage my
affairs myself. Ganéśa-man remained attached to
me: he was a pupil of Chatur Vapah, and practised
the restraining of the breath assiduously. The
Mobéd Hushíar says, he once saw him when, sitting
cross-legged, he restrained his breath so that
his belly, filled with wind, extended beyond his
knees. The Gosáin Chatur Vapah travelled to the
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
everlasting kingdom in the year 1047 of the Hejira
(1637 A. D.).</p>

<p>The author of this book saw, in the year 1053 of
the Hejira (1643 A. D.), Kalían Bharatí in Karitpúr in
the Kohistan of the Panjab, which was the country
of the rája Tarachandra. Kalían was a religious
man, and kept his breath for two watches, or six
hours. The Bháratís are a class of Sanyásis. From
Ferzánah Khushí, who is a pious man of the Yezdanían,
was received the information, that Kalíán
Bhárati used to drink, first, oil of lamps, and then
milk, both which he emitted again in such a manner
that the color of each was preserved, and no mixture
had taken place. Kalin Bhárati always praised
Persia; the author of this work told him: “You
have no connection in India; you should go there.”
He answered: “I went to Iran, but when I saw the
king of the country, Shah Abas Ibne Sultan,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span>
who
ought to be a servant of God, I found him to be
full of years, and although highly intelligent, yet
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
merciless, a shedder of blood, covetous, a word-breaker,
a friend to jesting, and admirer of buffoonery.
In his country it was promulgated that
wherever a boy or girl gifted with beauty could
be found, they should be brought before the king.
The Sufís of the tribe Kazelbásh brought boys
and girls to the king, that he might indulge himself
in any shameful act of his liking. I asked
myself whether, if such a behaviour were conformable
to their religion, I could remain in this
town? When I inquired about it from their
learned men, they denied it. I further asked,
whether the king approves of such deeds? They
said: ‘These are deeds, customary with men of
our faith.’ I then again said to myself: the king
is the substitute of God; if he himself goes astray,
is not firm in his faith, and does not disavow any
part of this religion, then it is not advisable to
remain in this town.” Kalin Bharati also said:
“I cannot bear seeing a man who is not firm in his
faith; one who professes no religion at all is, at
least, his own guide; the professor of any faith
who does what he says, and is fixed in it, deserves
not to be blamed.”</p>

<p>The writer of this book found, in the year 1048
of the Hejira (1638 A. D.), Aisha Girda, in Kashmir.
Ferzanah Khushí says, that he kept his breath during
three watches, or nine hours, and he found Maden
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
Kir equal to him. This was a man skilled in all
sorts of magic and sleight of hand: whenever well
disposed, he scattered bread and salt about, brought
milk forth from bones, cut bones in two with a hair,
and passed birds’ eggs through the narrow neck of
a bottle, and exhibited such like tricks.</p>

<p>Other Sanyásis remain twelve years standing upon
one leg, and this class is called <span class="title">Thávésar</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></span>
Those
who keep continual silence are called <span class="title">Máunínas</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span>
Many other, like these, are mentioned in Hindu
books, which the author of this work perused, but
has no room for describing them all in these pages;
some of this class are men of consideration and opulence,
and are escorted by files of elephants; they
have carriages, fine apparel, courtiers, servants, on
foot and horseback.</p>

 Professor Wilson (see his Sketch of the Religious Sects of the Hindus,
in the <abbr title="Sixteenth volume">XVIth vol.</abbr> of the <cite><abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 1-136) has enumerated the religious
divisions of the Hindus as they have been described by the author of the
<cite>Sankara Vijaya</cite>, probably in the 8th century of our era, to which enumeration
he added that of the present divisions of this people, comprised
in three great classes: the <span class="title">Vaichnavas</span>, the <span class="title">Sâivas</span>, and the <span class="title">Saktas</span>.
Very few names of these sects are to be found in The Dabistán, although
both works agree in general in the account of the opinions, rites, and
customs of the different sectaries; the outlines of their systems appear to
have remained the same during at least the last thousand years, whatever
alterations the details may have undergone.</p>

 According to the Shah-nameh, Afrasiab, after many battles, succombed
to the fortune of Kaí-Khusro. The king of Turan fled to the
mountains of Berdah, where he concealed himself in a cavern. It so
happened that Hum, a descendant of Feridun, lived as a hermit in the
same desert: there he heard by night a voice of complaint, which he
soon recognised to be that of Afrasiab. The hermit had not extinguished
the vindictive passion in his breast; he seized and bound the fugitive
king, and conducted him to be delivered into the hands of Káí Khusró.
On the bank of a large river, Hum, visited by a feeling of pity, loosened
the fetters of his prisoner, who profited by these few moments of liberty
to escape, and dived into the water, where he remained concealed, as is
said above, so that he could not be discovered. Káí Khusró, having in
the mean time arrived to receive himself the great captive, Hum advised
the king to subject Gorshivez (Afrâsiab’s brother) who was also a prisoner
in his hands, to severe tortures, in order that the lamentations of the
sufferer might draw Afrasiab out of the water. This stratagem succeeded,
and Afrasiab was killed by the sword of Káí Khusró.</p>

 The king of Persia above mentioned was probably Abbas, the son of
Shah Muhammed Mirza. He began to reign in 1585, and died in 1628,
in his 70th year. He was called “the Great,” although his character
and life were stained by vices but too common to Oriental princes. To
him succeeded his grandson Shah Súfí, in 1627, and died in 1641; then
the son of the latter, Abbas <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, not yet ten years old, was proclaimed
king; at the date above mentioned, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 1643, he was about twelve years
old, and could therefore not be the king characterised by Kalin Bharati,
who could very easily, but fifteen years before the epoch above mentioned,
have seen Abbas “the Great,” then, as he says, “full of years.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the seventh describes the tenets of the
Sáktían</span>.&mdash;The belief of this sect is as follows:
Síva, that is Mahádeva, who in their opinion with
little exception is the highest of the deities, and the
greatest of the spirits, has a spouse whom they call
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
<dfn>Máyá saktí</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span>
this spouse shows first one color, and
then another, that is, something else than what
really exists: for instance, water like wine. This
spiritual and material principle has three natures
and three qualities, namely: <dfn>rajas</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span>
that is, “dominion
and desire;” <dfn>sattva</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span>
which is “rectitude
and wisdom, and the power to control the senses,
not to be subject to them;” and <dfn>tamas</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span>
or “violence,
passion, besides eating, gluttony, and sleeping.”
With the Hindus, Brahma, Vichnu, and
Mahadeva are personified as proceeding from these
three conditions,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_236" id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>
or as the powers of the three
qualities mentioned. This Máyá is the maker of the
productions of this world and of its inhabitants, and
the creator of the spirits and of the bodies; the universe
and its contents are born from her: from
respect of the said productions and of the mentioned
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
effects, she is entitled <span class="title">Jagat-ambá</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span>
or “mother of
the universe;” non-entity finds no access to this
creator; the garment of perishableness does not sit
right upon the body of this fascinating empress;
the dust of nothingness does not move round the
circle of her dominion; the real beings of heaven,
and the accidental creations of the nether world, are
equally enamoured and intoxicated of desire before
her; bound by these ties of deceit in this revolving
world, whoever rebels feels the desire of <dfn>mukt</dfn>, that
is, of emancipation, independence, and happiness;
nevertheless, from carelessness, he pays obedience
and worship to this world-deceiving queen, and
never abandons the path of adoration of this bewitching
lady. This goddess, that is the spiritual
principle, exists in all living beings in six circles,
which they call <span class="title">shat chakras</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span>
as the fibres in the stalk
of a water-lily, in which there are six divisions: 1.
the <dfn>Muládhára</dfn>, or “the sitting-place;” 2. the <dfn>Manipúram</dfn>,
that is, “the navel;” 3. the <dfn>Swadhishtanam</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_239" id="fnanchor_239"></a><a href="#footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></span>
“the firm place, and which commands the upper
region of the navel;” 4. <dfn>Hrid</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_240" id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span>
or “the heart;”
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
5. <dfn>Sáda</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span>
that is, “the purified mansion and the place
of purification,” and this proceeds from the upmost
part of the breast; 6. <dfn>Agni tchakra</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span>
or “the circle
of the fire,” and this is that of the eye-brows.
These are the six circles, and above them is <dfn>Indra</dfn>,
that is the window of life, and the passage of the
soul, which is the top and middle of the head; and
in that place is the flower of the back of one thousand
leaves: this is the residence of the glorious
divinity, that is, of the world-deceiving queen, and
in this beautiful site reposes her origin. With the
splendour of one hundred thousand world-illuminating
suns, she wears, at the time of rising, manifold
odoriferous herbs and various flowers upon her
head and around her neck: her resplendent body is
penetrated with perfumes of various precious ingredients,
such as musk, safran, sandal and amber, and
bedecked with magnificent garments: in this manner,
as was just described, she is to be represented.
The worship of her form and appearance, the adoration
and submission, ought to be internal and true;
and the exterior veneration, to be paid before her
image; moreover, all that has been divided into five
sections and explained in the Yoga śastra, is to be
performed with assiduity. The interior worship
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
consists in representing her image, and in keeping
her remembrance every where; the possessor of
such an imaginative faculty and devotedness is called
<dfn>bhakta</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span>
that is, “a possessor of gladness and of the
mansion of perfect delight, and of <dfn>mukt</dfn>, or ‘liberation’
to be enjoyed in this mansion of a permanent
happy existence.” The mode of this worship
is contained in the <cite>Agama</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span>
and the whole sect
conform themselves to it. With them, the power
of Mahadeva’s wife, who is Bhávání, surpasses that
of the husband. The zealous of this sect worship
the <dfn>Síva-linga</dfn>, although other Hindus also venerate
it. <dfn>Linga</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span>
is called the virile organ, and they say on
behalf of this worship that, as men and all living
beings derive their existence from it, adoration is
duly bestowed on it. As the linga of Mahadeva, so
do they venerate the <dfn>bhaga</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span>
that is, the female
organ. A man very familiar with them gave the
information that, according to their belief, the high
altar, or principal place in a mosque of the Muselmans,
is an emblem of the <dfn>bhaga</dfn>. Another man
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
among them said that, as the just-named place
emblems the bhaga, the minar, or turret of the
mosque represents the linga: on which account both
are found together. In many places and among a
great number of the Hindus, this worship exists: a
great many follow the Agama, in which wine drinking
is approved, and if, instead of a common cup, a man’s
skull (which they call <span class="title">kapála</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span>) be used, the beverage
is much more agreeable. They hold the killing of
all animals, even of man, to be permitted, and call
it <dfn>bala</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span>
At night they go to the places which they
call <dfn>śmaśána</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span>
and where the dead bodies are burnt;
there they intoxicate themselves, eat the flesh of the
corpses burnt, and copulate before the eyes of others
with women, which they name <dfn>śakti púja</dfn>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span>
and if
the devoted woman be that of another, the good
work is so much the more valuable, and it is certain
that they offer their wives to each other; the disciples
bring their wives and daughters to their preceptor;
they unite with their mothers, sisters, paternal
and maternal aunts, which is against the custom
of the Hindus, who do not take daughters of their
near relations. The author of this work saw one of
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>
the learned men of this sect, who read to him a book
of modern composition upon their customs, and
therein was stated that it is permitted to mix with
every woman except one’s daughter. This man
began to abuse the work, saying that the text was
contrary to the old customs of this class, and that
no such thing is to be found in the ancient books,
and declared it at last to be a mistake of the copyist.
They say that the woman exists for the sake of being
desired; she may be a mother or a daughter. In
their opinion, there is no enjoyment higher that that
of love; the Hindus call it <dfn>kámada</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
and say that,
when a woman and a man are in close conversation,
whoever disturbs them is worthy of God’s malediction,
because they both therein share a state of happiness.
The Agama favors both sexes equally, and
makes no distinction between women; they may
belong to whomsoever: men and women compose
equally humankind, and whatever they bring forth
makes part of it. This sect hold women in great
esteem, and call them <dfn>śaktis</dfn> (powers); and to ill treat
a <dfn>śakti</dfn>, that is, a woman, is held a crime. The high
and low value the Lulís (public girls) very high, and
call them <dfn>deva kanya</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span>
“daughters of the gods.”</p>

<p>Among them, it is a meritorious act to sacrifice
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
a man, which they call <span class="title">naramédha</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span>
then the <dfn>gómédha</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span>
or sacrifice of a cow; further, the <dfn>asvaméda</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span>
and finally, any other animal. When they perform
a sacrificial ceremony, which they call Kála-dek (<dfn>kaladéya</dfn>)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span>,
they unite the blood of as many animals as
possible in a large vase, and place therein the man
whom they bring over to their creed, and they drink
with him from that blood. Whenever the worship
of a god, or of the wife of a god is performed, the
ceremony is called <span class="title">ishtam</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span>
and the master of the
ceremony <span class="title">ishta</span>. The creed of this sect is, that any
god or wife of a god may be worshipped in two ways:
the one is called <span class="title">bhadram</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span>
which consists in abstaining
from shedding blood, and in being pure; the
other, termed <dfn>vakam</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span>
which admits spilling blood,
commerce with women, and neglect of purity; but
they think this second preferable, and say that each
deity, male or female, has a form under which he
or she is to be represented; but that the worship of
a female divinity affords a greater recompense.
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
When they have an intimate connection with their
own or another’s wife, they behold in her the image
of the goddess, and think to personate the god, her
husband, and at this time they sing a prescribed
song, which to entune at the very moment of the
closest junction, they believe to be most recommendable.
There is a deity whose praise they
sing with unwashed hands;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span>
and another whom they
worship with the mark of their cast drawn with dirt
on their forehead. Some of these goddesses are by
them called “queens,” and others “servants;” and
the worshipper of a woman is also termed “servant.”</p>

<p>The author of this work saw a man who, singing
the customary song, sat upon a corpse which he
kept unburied until it came to a state of dissolution,
and then ate the flesh of it; this act they hold
extremely meritorious. They say that the desires of
this and of the other world attain their accomplishment
by means of the worship of a god or of a goddess.
The followers of this sect send their barren
wives, in order that they may become pregnant, to
the performers of such acts, and these men use the
women before the eyes of their husbands: whoever
does not send his wife to his master, renders in their
opinion the purity of his faith very doubtful.</p>

<p><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">157</span>
The Gossain Tara lochana, a Brahman, was of
this sect, and devoted to the worship of Káli, a
female deity. Having gone to Kachmir in the year
1048 of the Hejira (1638 A. D.), he practised pious
austerity; at last, as is usual, he chose a concubine,
for which, they say, five things are requisite: fish,
wine, the wife of another man, flesh (if human flesh
so much the better) and a mantra, that is, a song.
The Hindus used to distinguish fish from flesh.
Finally, having accomplished the act of a Gosain,
Tara lochana became the friend of Ahsen Ulla, named
Zafer Khán ibne Khájá, Abul hasen Taramzi, who
was the governor of Kachmir: this took place by
the interest of the confidential servants of the lord’s
house, who were well disposed to be directed by a
perfect Gósain. The said lord wished Taralochana
to procure him victory over the Tibetans; the Gosain
promised it to him, provided he should conform himself
to his directions: Zafer Khan consented to it,
and a convention was concluded between them.
Tara lochana said: “Appoint a great number of
Lúlían who are never to separate from me, because
in our religion the intercourse with these is
preferable to that with other women, on which
account they are entitled <span class="title">Déva-Kanyá</span>, ‘the daughters
of the gods;’ my meal must never be destitute
of wine and other intoxicating liquors; to begin,
let a sheep be killed for me, and the necessaries
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
and materials of repast be prepared.” Zafer Khan
did all the Gosain demanded; when he made his
expedition to Tibet, he obtained a remarkable victory,
and returned triumphant. At last, a disagreement
took place between the Gosain and Zafer Khan;
the former quitted the latter, who soon after, on
account of a dispute between the Sonní and the Shiâh
of Kachmir, lost his consideration, and being obliged
to retire, went to Kabul; there Muhammed Tafer,
one of his relations, gave him some fatal stabs with
a poniard, in consequence of which he lay sick for
some time. Soon after he lost his office and property,
and remained long in Lahore without a situation.
The author of this book saw in the year 1055
of the Hejira (1645 A. D.) in Gujerat, a district of
the Panjab, Tara lochana, who told him “It was
on account of his difference with me that so
great a misfortune befel Zafer Khan.” Urfi of
Shiraz says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“The bounty of the Eternal does not reject the unbeliever,</div>
 <div class="i0">Provided he acquire perfection in the adoration of his idol.”</div>
</div>

<p>Shédosh, the son of Anosh declared: that, according
to the explainers of the law, there must be
observed in any pursuit a due relation and correspondence
to the intended purpose: further, in the
pursuit of a virtuous spirit, sanctity and purity are
required; but in the pursuit of a base spirit, nothing
of purity enters, and may be dispensed with. This
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
subject has been treated in the second section of the
work thereupon.</p>

<p>The writer of this book saw in the same year,
and in the place beforesaid of Guzerat, a man called
Mahadéo, who at night was always sitting upon a
dead body. I also saw Sadánand, of the same sect,
who said to one of his disciples: “I wish to perform
a rite, called the worship of the hair.”
The disciple brought his own daughter, and Sadánanda
gazed at her hair, kissed her face, and in
that way enjoyed her before the eyes of her father.
I saw besides a person who brought his wife to
him, saying: “I have no son in my house.” It
is the belief of this class that, if in such a manner
any one has intercourse with a barren woman, she
obtains whatever she desires; on that account, some
of the women, at the moment of intimate junction,
demand from the perfect man the gift of <dfn>mukt</dfn>, that is,
union with God Almighty, and emancipation from
this body. It was for that reason, that Sadánanda
used the woman before the eyes of her husband.
One day, Sadánanda sat in a burying place, naked,
with one of his friends, and drank wine, when one
of the orthodox Brahmans passed that way, and
saw these men. The disciples said: “This Brahman
will tell the people what he saw, and expose
us to ridicule.” Sadánanda replied: “It does not
matter.” When the Brahman came home, he died.</p>

<p><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
When in the year 1059 of the Hejira (1649 A. D.)
the author of this work happened to be in the district
of Kalinga, he saw in every village of this country
the image of a god, or of a spirit called by some
particular name, and each of these spirits is supposed
to be the author of some sickness or misfortune,
for the removing of which they offer their
prayers to him. One of these spirits is <span class="title">Anamberam</span>;
and when a person gets a pimple, he brings
an animal, commonly a domestic bird, to the chapel,
and sacrifices it. In the work <dfn>Khálasa al hayat</dfn>, “the
essence of life,” composed by Mulla Ahmed Tatvi,
is stated, that upon the sepulchre of <span class="person">Asefnívas</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span>
a sage of Greece, they used to sacrifice a bird,
and they say that, in the book which treats of
the ceremonies of pilgrimage to the before-named
deities, three kinds of sacrifices are enumerated:
agreeable perfumes, sweet cakes, and beverages;
besides Mulla Ahmed Tatvi mentions in his work
just before quoted, that <span class="title">Herámes</span> (that is Idris)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span>
has
established fumigations and wine of grapes for the
use of sacrifices.</p>

<p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
Among the great idols of the country or Kaling is
<span class="title">Gang-Durgá</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span>
They say, Ramachandra déo, one of
their great Rájas, descendant of the celebrated family
of Kaśyapa, ruled in Orissa. This Rája, having
called a goldsmith, gave him the mass of gold which
he demanded for making an image of Durga. The
goldsmith, having carried the gold home, intended
to form the goddess of copper and to purloin the
gold, thinking that, as to break into pieces an idol is
not permitted among the Hindus, he could keep the
gold without fear of discovery. With this project
he went to sleep. When he awoke, he saw that
one half of the gold remained on the spot, and that
the other half was formed into the image of Durgá;
having carried this with the remaining gold to Ramachandra
déo, and told the story, the Rája gave him
the residue of gold, and carried the idol, in his house
and in his travels, constantly with him. They say
that, after the death of Kaśyapa the Great, Makandéo
assembled under his sceptre the nations of this
country, and that Vichnunath déo Sukra conquered
the town Sri Kakul,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span>
from the Rája Nanda. Ramchandra
déo moved his army towards Sri Kakul,
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">162</span>
and took the fort; Vichnu-náth, being informed of
it, marched against him; Ramchandra déo, unable
to resist his force, fled; Ganga Durga was by her
guardians thrown away in a village, from whence
she fell into the hands of a Brahman, who flung her
into the barn of a villager. This man, having taken
her up, carried her to his house. The goddess appeared
to him in a dream, and said: “Offer me in
sacrifice thy eldest son, and I will make thee Rája.”
After a certain time, the villager told this secret to
Vishnu-náth déo, who, having taken the idol from
him, gave him a horse ornamented with gold, and a
magnificent dress, and carried the goddess to Naránya
púr, his residence. As she demanded from him also
the sacrifice of a man, Vichnu-náth déo killed every
year one of the thieves and like sorts of men before
her altar. After the death of Vichnu náth déo, his
sons did the same. When Vikramajet déo, who descended
from Vichna nath déo, was killed, and the
country disturbed by insurrections, then Dasvent-ráu,
who was one of the grand-children of Vichnu-náth
déo, having taken up Durga, fled from fear of
the army, commanded by Jalil ul Khader Tulají
Khan Bég, to Márkúl. Bhúpati, the Rája of Márkul,
being also afraid of the attack of the famous
general, sent him the goddess Durga, on Monday,
the ninth day of the month Rabish ul avel, of the
year 1062 of the Hejira (September, 1651, A. D.).
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
The idol was of gold, in the form of a female, with
limbs very well proportioned, four arms, in two of
her right hands carrying a three-pointed pike, which
the Hindus call <dfn>Trisúla</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span>
and with which the goddess
was striking <span class="title">Mahisha Asura</span>, a demon under the form
of a buffalo; he was beneath her right foot; in another
hand she had a white ball, and in the fourth, the
chakra, or discus, which is a circular weapon peculiar
to the Hindus; under her left foot was a lion,
and beneath him a throne. When they weighed
the image, they found it equal to four panchiri, measure
of the Dekhan. Even now, they sacrifice in
every village of the Kohistan of Nanda-púr, and
country adjacent, a man of good family.</p>

<p>Another idol, called <span class="title">Mávelí</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span>
is in the town of Bister.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_267" id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span>
The belief of the people there is that, when an
hostile army comes to attack them, the divinity, under
the form of a woman selling vegetables, goes into
the camp of the enemy, and whoever eats what she
offers, dies; and during the night she appears like
one of the public girls, and whoever finds her charming,
and calls her, meets with death. They relate
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
many strange and wonderful things about her.
When in the year of the Hejira 1069, A. D. 1658-9,
the famous general Tavaljí Khan Beg besieged and
took the fort Kot Bahar, which is stronger than the
fort of Bister, there died so many men and beasts
of various maladies and the particular effects of climate,
that their number exceeds all computation;
and this the inhabitants of the fort of Bister attributed
to the power of the goddess.</p>

<p>There is another class of followers of Síva, that
is, of Sáktían, whose creed is quite different from
that just before stated: they never have intercourse
with the wife of another; they drink no wine. The
adorers of Síva are obliged to drink wine in the
<cite>Síva-ratra</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span>
which is a sacred night: because it is
written in their books that they ought then to fill a
cup with wine and to drink it; as, according to the
rule of this sect, it is not a matter of choice to drink
wine; many who cannot get it, having procured a
draught of syrup, mix a little of a fermented liquor
with it to render it like wine, and take it for such,
calling it <dfn>pána</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_269" id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Sri Kanta, a Kachmirian, is conversant with
many sciences of the Hindus; he knows the sástras,
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
that is, the sástras of the Pandits, namely,
the <dfn>Smríti sastra</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_270" id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span>
or “the written law;” the <dfn>Kavi-sástra</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span>

“logic and

<dfn>Pátanjala</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_275" id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span>
that is, the restraining of the breath; he
knows besides very well the Vedanta, or metaphysics,
etc. In the year 1049 of the Hejira (1639 A. D.)
the author of this book saw him in Kachmir; he is
one of the saints of the Hindus. Sri Kant was
invested by the inhabitant of heaven, Núr-ed-din
Mahommed Jehangír Pádshah, with the dignity of
a judge of the Hindus, in order that they may be
tranquillised, and in every concern have nothing to
demand from the Muselmans: as it has been established
in the code of Akbar, that the tribes of mankind,
high and low, with the existing diversity of
creeds and difference of customs, which are all
under the trust of a beneficent lord, ought to dwell
in the shade of protection of a just king, and persevere
in the performance of their worship and the
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
exigencies of their devotion, so that, by the authority
derived from the chiefs, the sons of the age may not
stretch the hand of oppression over the condition of
the people.</p>

<p>The belief of the Hindus is as follows: all the
<dfn>tírths</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_276" id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span>
that is, “places of pilgrimage,” which are
in the world are in imitation of the fixed model <span class="place">Haratírth</span>,
which is in Kachmir; for, after having visited
the holy place of Kachmir, there is no desire to see
that of any other country; and they call it the great
place of pilgrimage, likewise <span class="title">prayága</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_277" id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span>
which is celebrated
at Máhábád; there are Shah abad ed-din púr,
and Gangavara, Lárasún, and Kisâlíhazra. There
are many miraculous things in Kachmir; one of them
is <span class="title">Sandebár</span>, and they relate: In ancient times, a holy
Brahman dwelt in a cavern of the mountain, where
he devoted himself to the worship of the Almighty
God. Once every year, he went to the Ganges to
bathe. After having passed several years in that
way, Gangá said to the Brahman: “Thou measurest
always such a length of road, on which thou dost
set aside the worship of God: my convention with
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
thee is this: that, when the sun reaches the constellation
of the Bull, I will three times a-day come
to thy resting-place.” From this time, when the
great luminary throws his effulgence towards the
constellation of the Bull, the water of the river springs
up boiling from the basin of the fountain, which is
near the place of his devotion. <span class="title">Sundeberari</span>, in the
cavern of the mountain, became celebrated: it is a
square basin, and has on its eastern wall an open
cavity, from which, as well as from several other
vents and holes in the sides of the basin, the water
springs up. However steadfastly one may look, the
bottom cannot be discovered. And in the middle of
the eastern side, there are seven holes, which the
people of Kachmir call <dfn>Saptarshi</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_278" id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span>
“the seven Rishis;”
on the northern side is an issue, which they
call <dfn>dama bhaváni</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_279" id="fnanchor_279"></a><a href="#footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></span>
when the world-illuminating sun
begins to enter the constellation of the Bull, the
water appears there in the following manner: it
springs up first from the large cavity, then from the
<dfn>Saptarshi</dfn>: so the Hindus call seven rakshasas, and
give their name to the constellation of the Great
Bear. Further, the water comes up from the <dfn>dama
bhaváni</dfn>, that is “the mansion of <dfn>Bhaváni</dfn>, the wife
of Mahadéo.” When the cavity is filled, then the
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
water, passing over the borders, runs out; the
Sanyásis and other Hindus, who had come from
distant places, throw themselves into it, and the
people who find no room, carry water from it.
Afterwards, the ebullition declines in such a manner,
that there remains not the least trace of the
water. In this month the water boils up three times
a-day, namely, in the morning, at mid-day, and in
the afternoon, at the hour of prayer. After the lapse
of this month, no more water is seen, until the sun
enters again into the sign of the Bull.</p>

When he had attained his eighteenth year, he was
conversant with all the liberal sciences. They relate,
that Amír Nuh, the son of Manzur Sámáni,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_283" id="fnanchor_283"></a><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span>
in a
grave malady, when the doctors knew no remedy,
was restored to health by the salutary power of the
songs of Abu Ali. When the Sámánían were in
distress, he directed himself towards Khórasan, the
king of which country, Alí, the son of Mámun Massar,
received Abu Ali with perfect favour. When
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
Abu Ali was accused before the Sultan Mahmud
Sabak tegín,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span>
of being opposed to the religion and
creed of the ancient wise men, and when the Sultan
showed a disposition to apprehend him, the
Shaikh was alarmed and fled to Abyúverd; the satellites
of the Sultan followed him with pictures and
descriptions of his person, which were well drawn,
and sent by the Sultan to all parts of the kingdom,
in order that the magistrates and head men of office,
by means of this picture might bring the fugitive
before the Sultan. The Shaikh, informed of it, fled
towards Jorjan (Georgia). By means of the remedies
of the Shaikh, many sick were cured. Shamsen
ul mâlí Kábús, the son of Vashamger,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span>
had a
nephew on his sister’s side on a sick-bed, all the
remedies applied by the physicians proved useless;
by order of Kabus, they brought the Shaikh to the
pillow of the sick; but, in spite of all his cares and
observations, the learned physician could not discover
the cause of his illness. The Shaikh said
to himself: “This young man may be in love, and
from exceeding pudicity keep his secret unclosed.”
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
On that account he ordered the names of all the
places and towns to be written, and one after another
to be read before the patient, whilst the Shaikh
held his finger upon the pulse of the young man.
When they pronounced the name of the abode of
the beloved, the motion of the pulse of the enamoured
was perceptible; the Shaikh ordered also the
names of all the private houses to be read; at that of
the object of his desires, the pulse of the desirous
became disturbed; moreover they began to read the
names of the inhabitants of the houses; when they
arrived at that of his idol, the pulse of the adorer
again beat higher. Mazheri of Kashmir says:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The pulse of the loving beats higher, agitated only at the name of the
   beloved.”</div>
</div>

<p>Thus, the perfect science of Abu Alí found the
true remedy: he said to one of the head men near
Shams ul mâlí: “This young man is in love with
such a girl, in such a house, and there is no
remedy but the gratification of his desire.” After
trial, the truth of these words was found.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_286" id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Umras and the ministers of state withdrew
from the obedience of Kábus, whom they imprisoned,
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>
the Shaikh retired into the country. Some
time after, he betook himself to Ráí.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_287" id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span>
Majed-dóulah
Abu Táleb Rustam, the son of Fakher ed dóulah
Dalímí, the Hakim (governor) of Rái,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span>
showed him
great regard and honor; the Shaikh restored Majed
ud-dóulah from the malady of melancholy to good
health.</p>

<p>When Shams ed-dóulah made war upon Helál,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_289" id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span>
son of Bader, son of Hasnávíah, who came from
the capital of the right faith (Mecca), he defeated
the army of Bâghdad. The Shaikh went from Rái
to Kazvín,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_290" id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span>
and from thence to Hamdan.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_291" id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span>
Shams
ed-dóulah was cured of a colic by the remedies of
the Shaikh, whom he then raised to the dignity of a
Vizír. The chiefs of the army conspired against
the life of Abu Ali; he fled, and remained concealed
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
during forty days. Meanwhile, the malady of Shams
ed-doulahreturned; the Shaikh, having come forth
from his place of concealment, delivered the Sultan
from his illness, and was again raised to the Vizirat.
After the death of Shams ed-doulah, the throne was
filled by Bahá ed-dóulah, the son of Táj ed dóulah.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_292" id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span>
The Umrahs requested Abu Alí to accept the Vizírat,
but he refused his consent. About this time, Aláded-dóulah,
the son of Jâfer Kakyuah,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_293" id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></span>
sent from
Iśfahan an invitation to the venerable Shaikh to join
him; but the Shaikh declined to come, and concealed
himself in the house of Abu Táleb, a dealer
in perfumes. Without the example of any other
work before his eyes, he composed his work, entitled
<dfn>Shafá</dfn>, “remedy,” treating the whole of physics
and metaphysics.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Tájed doulah, having assumed the name of Alaved-dóulah,
kept the Shaikh, by this assumption,
employed in a continual succession of affairs. When
Alawed dóulah conquered the country of Tájed ud
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
dóulah, he brought the Shaikh to Iśfahán.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span>
Towards
the end of his life, a disease of the bowels seized
the Shaikh, and gained strength, on account of his
active life in the service of Alawed dóulah, and of the
expeditions of his enemies. The patient was carried
in a covered chair. When Aladed-dóulah came to
Hamdán, the Shaikh felt that nature had exhausted
her strength, and could not resist the force of the
malady; on that account, having desisted from applying
any remedy, he took a bath, and having distributed
his property in alms to the poor, the indigent,
and the necessitous, he turned his mind to God and
the elect of the divinity; at last, on a Friday, in the
month of Ramzán, of the year 427 of the Hejira (1035
A. D.), he passed from this deceitful world to the
residence of happiness.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_296" id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></span>
A great man said:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“From the globe of black clay to the summit of Venus,</div>
 <div class="i0">I traversed all the difficulties of the world;</div>

 Mansur <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, son of Abdelmalek, was the sixth king of the Samánís:
this dynasty derived their name from Sámán, whose father is unknown.
Sámán, a robber, had a son, Assad, who quitted the infamous profession
of his father, and educated his sons in a manner which enabled them to
rise to the highest dignities under the Khalif Al-Mamon and his successors.
Ismâil, a grandson of Assad, founded the princely dynasty in Mavaralnahar
(Transoxana), to which other provinces were annexed. Nine
Samanian kings ruled from the year of the Hejira 261 to 388 (A.
D. 874-998).</p>

Nighiaristan, quoted by Herbelot, Avisenna, when at the court of Mamon,
king of Khorasan, was called by Mahmúd to his own capital; the refusal
of the Shaikh to obey drew upon him Mahmud’s persecutions.</p>

 The sagacity of Avisenna can but remind us of that with which
Eristratus, a disciple of Chrysippus and grandson of Aristotle, discovered
the secret cause of the mortal malady of Antiochus, son of the Syrian
king Seleucus: the young prince was in love with his stepmother, Stratonice.
But Kabus, for preserving the life of his nephew, was subject to no
personal sacrifice; Seleucus saved his son by the cession of his own wife.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the eighth: of the Vichnuian (Va&nbsp;ishnavas)
worshippers of Vichnu.</span>&mdash;Vichnu, who, according to
the belief of the followers of the Smriti, is a subordinate
divinity, is held by the Vichnuian to be the
preserver of all things. The Vedantían maintain
him to possess the qualities of virtue and of order,
and to be the lord of the five senses; not subject
however to the said senses, nor to their influence
in any way. According to the Vichnuían, he is the
first cause and author of the universe; they believe
him endowed with a body, like mankind; he has a
wife. Brahma, a deity, is the creator of things; and
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
Mahádéo, another divinity, the annihilator of beings;
both are creators of Vichnu, and distinct from his
holy being, because the path of union is closed between
the creature and the creator; they say, that
every body has a soul, but that the soul is not distinct
from, but a part of, the body; the body has
two forms, the male and female, and the creator
and author of their being is the holy nature of
Vichnu; the body is composed of five elements;
men, conformably with their actions and works, are
invested either with animal or human forms; the
soul is always confined in the gaol of ignorance and
in the fetters of avidity. Further, the spirits are
divided according to three qualities, which are: 1.
<dfn>sattvam</dfn>; 2. <dfn>rájas</dfn>; and 3. <dfn>tamas</dfn>: the explanation of
these three qualities has been before given. The
<dfn>Satya</dfn> (virtuous) tends towards <dfn>mukt</dfn>, that is, “emancipation;”
for by the power of this laudable quality,
he makes the <dfn>bakhti</dfn>, that is, “the worship of
Vichnu,” his pursuit; and this <dfn>bakhti</dfn> raises him to
the highest state, that is, to that of “emancipation;”
according to the interpretation of this sect, <dfn>mukt</dfn> consists
in this: that, after having left the <dfn>sthúla sarira</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_298" id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span>
or “elementary body,” and the <dfn>linga sarira</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_299" id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span>
that
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
is, “the visional body,” which has fallen into a vision
of appearances, and after having been transformed
into the primitive shape, which is either male or
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
female, one enters the <dfn>Váikunt</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span>
that is, “the heaven
of beatitude of the Gods,” and the mansion of real
life. <dfn>Rájas</dfn>, that is, the possessor of this quality, is
liable to recompense or punishment; to the consequence
of virtue or crime, according to an impartial
appreciation of both. Now he holds the price
of virtue, another time that of crime; and conformably
to his merits or demerits, he migrates invested
with a body, and for reward is associated with
the blessed, or for punishment suffers witth the
damned. Whoever does not, from the circle of the
world, reach the shore of those who are united with
salvation, he shall certainly never attain to the state
of the desired emancipation. <dfn>Tamas</dfn>, that is, the
possessor of this quality, is an adversary to <span class="title">mukt</span>, and
an enemy to liberation; his present and future condition
is this: that, having left the <dfn>sthúla saríra</dfn>,
that is, “his elemental body,” and the <dfn>linga purusha</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_301" id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span>
or “his visional body,” and having returned to his
primitive form, either male or female, he will be
tormented in the world of darkness, which they call
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
<dfn>andhatamasa</dfn>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_302" id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span>
from this place of manifold torments
he never returns. This is the substance of the creed
of the worshippers of Vichnu, called Madhu Acháris.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_303" id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The belief of another sect of the Vichnavas, called
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
<span class="title">Rámánandis</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span>
is in substance as follows: the quality of
<span class="title">Satwa</span> tends towards the attainment of the high state
of <dfn>mukt</dfn>, or “emancipation;” the way of acquiring
it is, to lay aside all praises of another divinity;
to abstain from the rites of any other sect; and to
shun any other worship except that of the holy being
of Vichnu, to whom alone all thoughts, all prayers,
are to be directed, and whose remembrance is always
to be kept. In the same manner as it is not permitted
to a husband to desire the wife of another, in
the same way they hold it wrong to think of any
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
other deity but of Vichnu. The difference between
the beforesaid and this sect is, that the former associates
to the worship of Vichnu that of other angels,
of the creatures, servants, and companions of this
God, which they maintain as meritorious, and perform
with magnificence; whilst the latter sect considers
the other deities as deformed and hideous.</p>

<p>The characteristical mark of the Rámánandis is a
triangle drawn upon their forehead;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_305" id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></span>
they never eat
their meal before persons of another sect. The
<span class="title">Madhu Achárís</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_306" id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span>
wear two short strokes of red clay
near each other upon the forehead; they do not
associate with persons of another creed, but they
eat before Brahmans who are not of their own peruasion.</p>

<p>A third sect is that of the <span class="title">Harbayántís</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_307" id="fnanchor_307"></a><a href="#footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></span>
They drink
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
with Brahmans of another persuasion from the same
cup, and wear a circle as a mark on their foreheads.</p>

<p>A fourth sect is that of the <span class="title">Rádhá-Vallabhis</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_308" id="fnanchor_308"></a><a href="#footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></span>
these
are bound by nothing; they observe no fast on the
eleventh day of the month; they deliver their wives
to the disposition of their preceptors and masters,
and hold this praiseworthy.</p>

<p>In Hindostan it is known that whoever abstains
from eating meat and hurting living animals, is
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
esteemed a Vaishnava, without regard to the doctrine
beforesaid. Some of them take the name of Rama,
who is also a manifestation of Vichnu; others choose
the title of Kishen (Krichna), another incarnation of
Vichnu. The reputation of continence and purity
prevails in favor of those who are called after Rama;
whilst those who take their title from Krishna are
ill-famed for sensuality and libidinousness. It happened
one day that a worshipper of Rama met with
an adorer of Krishna; the former repeated perpetually
“Ram, Ram;” the latter was occupied with the
praise of Krichna, to whom the worshipper of Rama
said: “Why dost thou repeat without end the name
of a man who was devoted to sensuality, the name
of Krichna?” He answered: “Because this name
is better than that of a man who knew not even
how to be certain of the honor of one woman.”
This was said in allusion to Râma’s having banished
his wife, named Sitâ, at the end of the fire-ordeal
which she underwent to prove her purity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_309" id="fnanchor_309"></a><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span>
Some
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
of the pious of this sect eat no sort of turnips or
carrots which in eating, by taste or color, may
remind of flesh. The writer of this work heard from
Hansa rádja, a Brahman, that it is written in ancient
books of this class, that Brahmans used to fly in the
air and to walk upon the water, when, on account
of having polluted their lips by eating flesh, they lost
this power. As the Vairágis, too, profess to be Váishnavas,
I will treat of them in the following article.</p>

This sect renounces the world;
their liturgy is in verse, and comprehends the worship
of Vichnu and his incarnations, as Rama, Krichna,
and the like, and these verses they call <span class="title">Vichnu padam</span>.
They make pilgrimages to the holy places dedicated
to Vichnu, and wear around their necks rosaries of
<dfn>tutasí</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_311" id="fnanchor_311"></a><a href="#footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></span>
which they call <span class="title">malá-tulasí</span>. Tulasí is an Indian
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
shrub. Whoever among the Hindus, Muselmans, or
others, wishes, is received into their religion; none are
rejected, but, on the contrary, all are invited. It is
said that some Muselmans also worship Vichnu, because
in “<dfn>Bismilla</dfn>,” they confound <dfn>Bisem</dfn> with <dfn>Bishen</dfn>
(or Vichnu), and most of them agree about the purity
and infinity of Vichnu’s being; in truth, they think
he is incorporeal; the spirits proceed like rays from
the light of his being, and all bodies from the shadow
of his existence; but they say that when he wills he
shows himself, as it happened, with four arms, and
they agree about his having manifested himself in
ten incarnations. They abstain from eating flesh.
They are divided into four classes: <dfn>Rámánujas</dfn>, <dfn>Nimánujas</dfn>,
<dfn>Madhuacháris</dfn>, and <dfn>Radha Vallabhis</dfn>, as before said:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_312" id="fnanchor_312"></a><a href="#footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></span>
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>

<p>Kabir,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_314" id="fnanchor_314"></a><a href="#footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span>
a weaver by birth, celebrated among those
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
Hindus who professed their belief in the unity of
God, was a Váiragi. They say that, at the time
when he was in search of a spiritual guide, he visited
the best of the Muselmans and Hindus, but did not
find what he sought. At last, somebody gave him
direction to an old man of bright genius, the Brahman
Rámánanda. This sage never saw the face of a
Muselman, nor of any other religionist. Kabir,
knowing that Rámánand would not converse with a
weaver, dug a hole upon the accustomed road of the
Brahman, and placed himself therein. Towards the
night Rámánand used to go to bathe on the border
of a river, and at the time when, to wash his body
and purify his soul with the water of sanctity, he
bent his steps towards a house of prayer, he arrived
on the border of the hole made by Kabir, who, coming
forth, clasped the feet of Rámánanda. As the Brahman
harboured in his mind no other thought but
that of God the highest, under the name of Rámá,
he called out: “Rám!” When Kabir heard “Rám”
from the tongue of Rámánand, he withdrew his
hands from the Brahman’s feet, and ceased not to
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
repeat the word “Rám, Rám!” so that no other
object but that was hovering before his eyes, as
before those of Rámánanda; and he discoursed about
the unity of God in sublime speeches, such as are
heard only from the most learned men. Kabir,
having acquired reputation, people said to Rámánand:
“There is a weaver in this town who wishes
to be your disciple; it is to be regretted that you
cannot be connected with a weaver, who is a man
of a low caste.” Rámánand answered: “Call him
to me,” which was done. When Kabir’s eye fell
upon that of Rámánanda, the former exclaimed:
“Rám, Rám!” the latter repeated “Rám, Rám!”
and clasped Kabir fast in his arms, to the great astonishment
and wonder of the people around, who
asked the reason of such a favor. Rámánand replied:
“Now Kabir is a Brahman, because he
knows Brahma, that is, the supreme Being.”</p>

<p>It is said, that a class of learned Brahmans, sitting
on the border of the river Ganga, praised its water,
because it washes away all sins. Whilst so speaking,
one of the Brahmans wanted water; Kabir, who had
heard their speeches, jumped up from his place, and
having filled a wooden cup which he carried with
water, brought it to the Brahman. Kabir, a weaver
by birth, being of a low caste, from the hands of
whom Brahmans can neither eat nor drink, the
water was not accepted, upon which Kabir observed:
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
“You have just now declared, that the water of the
Ganga purifies the body and the soul from the
pollution of sins, and from the foulness of evil actions,
and makes them all disappear; but if this
water does not render pure this wooden vase, it
certainly does not deserve your praises.”</p>

<p>Among the Hindus it is an establised custom to
bring flowers to God at the time of worship. One
day Kabir saw a gardener’s wife who collected flowers
for the image of a deity; he said to her: “In the
leaves of the flower lives the soul of vegetation,
and the idol to whom thou offerest flowers is without
feeling, dead, without consciousness, in the
sleep of inertness, and has no life; the condition
of the vegetable is superior to that of the mineral.
If the idol possessed a soul, he would chastise the
cutter, who, when dividing the matter of which
the image is formed, placed his foot upon the
idol’s breast: go, and venerate a wise, intelligent,
and perfect man, who is a manifestation of
Vichnu.”</p>

<p>Kabir showed always great regard for the Fakírs.
One day, a number of Durvishes came to him; he
received them with respect in his house; as he possessed
nothing to show his generosity and munificence
to them, he went from door to door to procure
something, but having found nothing, he said to his
wife: “Hast thou no friend from whom thou mayst
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
borrow something?” She answered: “There is
a grocer in this street who threw an eye of bad
desire upon me; would I from this sinner demand
something, I should obtain it.” Kabir said: “Go
immediately to him, grant him what he desires,
and bring something for the durvishes.” The
woman went to the lewd grocer, and requested the
loan of what she required; he replied: “If thou
comest this night to me, thy request is granted;”
the woman consented, and swore the oath which he
imposed upon her to come; after which the grocer
gave her rice, oil, and whatever these men might
like. When the Fakírs, well satisfied, went to rest,
a heavy rain began to fall, and the woman wished
to break her engagement; but Kabir, in order to
keep her true to her word, having taken her upon
his shoulder, carried her in the dark and rainy
night, through the deep mud, to the shop of the
bad grocer, and placed himself there in a corner.
When the woman had entered into the interior part
of the house, and the man found her feet unsullied,
he said to her: “How didst thou arrive without thy
feet being dirty?” The woman concealed the fact.
The grocer conjured her by the holy name of God to
reveal the truth; the woman, unable to refuse, said
what had taken place. The grocer, on hearing this,
shrieked and was senseless. When he had recovered
his senses, he ran out and threw himself at
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
Kabir’s feet. Afterwards, having distributed among
the poor whatever he had in his shop, he became a
Virágí. Shaikh Mahmud said:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“When lust seizes the heart of man, God now and then renders vain
his intent.”</div>
</div>

<p>It is said that when Kabir left his elemental body,
the Muselmans assembled in order to give him a
burial, because they supposed him to have been of
the right faith; and the Hindus too crowded in order
to burn his body, because they thought him to have
professed their religion. At last a Fakír stept in
the midst of them, and said: “Kabir was a holy
man, independent of both religions; but having
during his life satisfied you, he will also, after
death, meet with your approbation.” Having then
opened the door, they did not find Kabir’s body, and
both parties remained astonished and bewildered.</p>

<p>Another of the celebrated Virágis was <span class="person">Dáyú</span>. One
day, when Brahmans and Bánians (that is, traders)
were assembled in a temple of Vichnu, they drove
Dáyú out of it, as not worthy of being among their
congregation. Dáyú, having gone out, sat down at
the back of the temple, which soon after turned
about towards the side where Dáyú was.</p>

<p><span class="person">Perah Káivan</span>, a Yezdánian, is one of the accomplished
saints, and shows himself in the dress of
every sect. When in that of a Vairági, he was in
Guzerat for the sake of a pleasure-walk, he saw some
of the Váirágis who came from a place of pilgrimage,
and had a mark impressed upon their hand and
arm: because, whoever makes a pilgrimage to the
holy place of Krichna, gets the form of the God’s
weapon (the diskus) imprinted upon his body by
means of a hot iron. Kaivan Perah said to the Vairágis:
“Why this wound?” they answered: “This
is the mark of Vichnu; whoever has it is by the
God recognised as being his.” Kaivan Perah
observed: “When the soul is separated from the
body, they burn the corpse; no mark of it remains;
whilst the soul is not perishable, and has
no mark: how will then Vichnu recognise it?”&mdash;When
he came to Ahmed-abad, which is the capital
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
of Guzerat, he saw a crier who, from the top of a
mosque, chanted his prayer; when he had come
down, Káivan Perah asked him: “Hast thou received
an answer?” the crier said: “From whom?”
Kaivan replied: “From him to whom thou hast
been calling.” Lubhaní says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“They call loud to God seeking him,</div>
 <div class="i0">This people think him, perhaps, to be far off.”</div>
</div>

<p>When he came to the harbour of Surat, which is
one of the principal ports of Hindostán, he met with
a Háji (a pilgrim from Mecca) who had come by sea
to the harbour; Kaiván Perah asked him: “Whence
dost thou come?” He answered: “From the
house of God.” Kaiván said further: “Hast
thou seen God?” The reply was “No.” “He was
perhaps not at home,” rejoined Kaiván, and the
Háji remained astonished.</p>

<p>The Vairágis are not devoted to a particular worship;
they say, the name of Vishnu suffices for the
acquisition of <dfn>mukt</dfn>, or “the union with God.” This
sect was formed during the Káli yúg, and call themselves
also Váichnavas: they renounce the world,
and say: “Our way is opposite to that of the Vêdas
and of the Koran: that is, we have nothing to do
either with Muselmans or Hindus.” A great
number of Muselmans adopted their creed, such as
Mirza Salah, and Mirza Háider, two noble Muselmans
who became Vaíragis. Of this sect was <span class="person">Naráin</span>
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
<span class="person">Dásí</span>, who sided with <span class="person">Rámánandis</span>, which is one of
the <dfn>Sampradayas</dfn>, that is the first of the four classes
before mentioned. The author of this book saw
him in the year 1052 of the Hejira (1642 A. D.) in
Lahore. He was one of those who are freed from
the affections of the world; he honored whomever
he saw, and said: “Every body belongs to the
divinity; that is, every body is the house of God.”</p>

</div>

<p>Píránah Kohely was of the sect of Vairagis, and
Kohelí is a tribe of Kshatriyas; he withdrew from
all the affections and troubles of the world. Having
left the Guzerat of Panjab, which is his native place
and the seat of his ancestors, he went to Vizírábád, a
city built by Hakím Ilam eddín, named <span class="place">Buzín khan</span>,
and chose to settle not far from the above mentioned
Guzerat. He had no faith in pious austerity. He
said, the saints are men who, in a former existence,
have brought affliction upon other men, and on that
account do penance in this world; every pious act
joined to some austerity is a requital of their
deeds; those who are fasting have, in a former
state, let hunger and thirst afflict the low and feeble;
those who watch at night have, in his opinion, prevented
the servants from sleeping; the Sanyásis,
called Thádéser, who remain years standing upon
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
one leg, he thinks to be a class of spirits who have
not permitted the servants to sit down; and those
who suspend themselves, and others who perform
their devotion in an inverted or strained posture,
are a class who used to suspend their inferiors; and
those who visit celebrated places and sacred mansions
of pilgrimage, are a set who, for trifling reasons,
have without pity sent about couriers to different
places, without paying them their hire; the
<dfn>játis</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_316" id="fnanchor_316"></a><a href="#footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></span>
that is, those who abstain from intercourse
with women, and from sensual indulgence, are an
order of spirits, who have not provided for their
sons and daughters the subsistence and furniture
requisite for the marriage state, and prohibited to
them this enjoyment, for which reason they now are
subjected to retaliating penance.</p>

<p>This sect do no harm to any living being; which
is common to all Vairágis, as well as to neglect devotion;
but, in opposition to the creed of the Vairágis,
they do not admit the <dfn>Avatars</dfn>, and say that God is
exempt from transmigration and union; and, according
to those who profess the belief in the unity and
solitariness of the supreme being, he is not susceptible
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
of (what we call) intimate friendship. Being
asked about the history of Krichna, Píránah said:
“He was a Rája, devoted to licentiousness, and
oppressing mankind.” The writer of these pages
saw Píranah in the year 1050 of the Hejira (1640
A. D.), in Vizirábád, and in the same year and in
the same place he saw Ananta, who was of the same
creed as Píránah, but particularly addicted to the
belief of the singleness of God.</p>

<p>Ananta did not advise abstinence to the sick. One
of his friends being attacked by a diarrhœa, Ananta
gave him substantial and sweet food, until he left
this elemental body. One of his disciples wanted to
have a vein opened; Ananda, having been informed
of it, expressed himself strongly against this operation
and prevented it. Thus, the author of these
pages saw, in the year of the Hejira 1050 (A. D. 1640)
in Guzerat of the Panjab, another of this sect, called
<span class="person">Mían Lál</span>, who was venerated by a great number of
his sectaries; he abstained from eating any sort of
animal food, and showed politeness to every body;
like Píránah, he never cleansed his patched garment
from vermin, and used to say: “These insects have
an assignment for their daily subsistence written
upon my body.” Váirágis are also called <span class="title">Mundís</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_317" id="fnanchor_317"></a><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span>
because they shave four parts of their bodies,
and one shaved is called <span class="title">Mundí</span>.<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span> There arose a dissension
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
between this sect and the Sanyásis; in the
year 1050 of the Hejira (1640 A. D.) a battle was
fought at Hardwar,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_318" id="fnanchor_318"></a><a href="#footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></span>
which is a holy place of the
Hindus, between the Mundís and the Sanyásis, in
which the latter were victorious and killed a great
number of the Mundís: these men threw away their
rosaries of Tulasi wood which they wear about their
necks, and hung on their perforated ears the rings
of the Jógís, in order to be taken for these sectaries.</p>

<p class="footnote">It is essential to know the exact meaning which the Hindus attach to
the three words, <dfn>linga</dfn>, <dfn>linga śarîra</dfn>, and <dfn>sthula śarîra</dfn>.</p>

<p class="footnote">I must premise that, according to them, the soul is incased as in a
sheath, or rather in a succession of sheaths. The first, or inner case, is
<dfn>the intellectual one</dfn>: it is composed of the pure, or simple, elements,
uncombined, the archetypes of elementary matter (<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">तन्मात्र</span> <dfn>tanma tra</dfn>),
and consists of the intellect (<dfn>buddhi</dfn>), joined with the five senses. The
next is the <dfn>mental sheath</dfn>, in which mind is joined with the preceding.
A third sheath comprises the organs of action and the vital faculties, and
is termed the <dfn>organic</dfn> or <dfn>vital case</dfn>.</p>

<p class="footnote">These three sheaths (<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">कोषाः</span> <dfn>kóshas</dfn>) constitute the subtile frame,
<dfn>s ukshma śarîra</dfn>, or <dfn>linga-śarîra</dfn>, “the rudimental body which attends
the soul in its transmigration.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><dfn>Linga</dfn> is “the naked rudiment;” the word expresses “designating,
apprising,” synonimous with “characteristic,” rendered also by “mergent,”
and by “subtile.” The linga and linga-śarîra are ordinarily,
though perhaps not properly, confounded, the linga consisting of thirteen
component parts, namely (see the <a href="#footnote_175">table of categories</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 122): of
intellect, egotism, and the eleven organs; whilst the linga-s arîra adds to
these a bodily frame, made up of the five rudimental elements. In this
form however they always coexist; and it is not necessary to consider
them as distinct.</p>

<p class="footnote">The “gross body,” <dfn>sthúla śarîra</dfn>, is composed of the coarse elements
formed by the combination of the simple elements in a particular proportion,
which the Hindus determine with an acuteness, their own (see <cite>Vedanta
sara</cite>, <abbr title="edition of Calcutta">edit. of Calc.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 11), but which is not necessary here to
adduce. This exterior case, composed of elements so combined, is the
“nutrimentitious sheath,” and being the scene of coarse fruition, is
therefore termed “the gross body.” This is however animated from
birth to death, in any step of its transmigration, by the interior rudiment
confined to the first-mentioned inner case, which is called <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">कारणशरीर</span>
<cite>kárańa-śarîra</cite>, “the causal frame”&mdash;(See Colebrooke on the Phil. of

<p class="footnote">Without entering here into the details of metaphysical refinements
which the Hindus exhibit in their various systems of philosophy, we may
content ourselves to state that, in general, they adopt two kinds of bodies
or persons, a subtile, and a substantial or grosser one. The first transmigrates
through successive bodies, which it assumes as a mimic shifts
his disguises to represent various characters. In the Bhagavad gita, it is
intimated, that soul retains the senses and mind in the intervals of migration:
“At the time that spirit obtains a body, and when it abandons
one, it migrates, taking with it those senses, as the wind wafts along
with it the perfumes of the flowers.” The grosser body, propagated
by generation, is perishable. According to Manu (<abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr> 16): “After
death, another body, composed of the five rudimental elements, is
immediately produced, for wicked men, that they may suffer the tortures
of the infernal regions.” This concords with what is said above.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_303" id="footnote_303"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_303"><span class="muchsmaller">[303]</span></a>
 They are also called <span class="title">Brahma Sampradáyis</span>. The founder of this
sect was Madhwácharya, a Brahman, born in the Saka-year 1121 (A. D.
1199), in Tuluva, on the western coast of the Indian peninsula; he died
in his seventy-ninth year. He was early initiated into the order of Anchorets,
and devoted to Vichnu; he composed thirty-seven works, built
eight temples, and founded as many <dfn>maths</dfn>, or “monasteries” of his
particular sect, which is one of the four great sects. The superiors, or
“Gurus” of it are Brahmans and Sanyásis; their lay-votaries are members
of every class of society except the lowest; they profess perpetual
celibacy. These sectaries reside now chiefly in the peninsula, and are
altogether unknown in Gangetic Hindostan. To what is above said of
their doctrine, I shall add, that they distinguish the principle of life from
the supreme Being, or they deny the absolute unity of the Deity, and the
possibility of absorption into the universal spirit, and the loss of independent
existence after death.&mdash;(See an explicit account of this sect,
by Professor Wilson, <cite><abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="volume Sixteen pages">vol. XVI. p.</abbr> 100-108.)</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_304" id="footnote_304"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_304"><span class="muchsmaller">[304]</span></a>
 Rámánanda, the founder of this sect, lived about the end of the 13th
century, according to some accounts; Professor Wilson is disposed to place
him not farther back than the end of the 14th, or beginning of the 15th
century. His residence was at Benares, in a <dfn>math</dfn>, or “monastery.” The
especial object of the worship of the Rámánandis is Vichnu, in his incarnation
of <span class="title">Rámachandra</span>, on which account they are called <span class="title">Rámawats</span>.
The mendicant members of this sect, numerous even in our days, are
usually known as Váîragis or Viraktas, and consider all form of adoration
superfluous beyond the incessant invocation of Krichna and Rama.
The school of Rámánand admits disciples of every caste; it abrogates, in
fact, the distinction of caste amongst the religious orders: this seems the
proper import of the term <dfn>Avad’huta</dfn>, which Rámánanda affixed to his
followers. It does not appear that any work exists attributed to Rámánand
himself; those of his followers are written in the provincial dialects.
The ascetic and mendicant followers of Ramánand are by far the most
numerous class of sectaries in Gangetic India; some of them acquired a
great celebrity; among these are reckoned <span class="person">Kabir</span>, of whom hereafter,
and <span class="person">Jayadiva</span>, the author of the beautiful poem <cite>Gîta govinda</cite>, well
known by the translations made of it into English, by Sir W. Jones; into
Latin, by Professor Lassen (who places however Jayadéva in the year
1150); and into German, in the metre of the original, by Mr. Ruckert.&mdash;(See,
on the Rámánandis, the work quoted, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 36-52).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_305" id="footnote_305"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_305"><span class="muchsmaller">[305]</span></a>
 According to Professor Wilson (work quoted, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 32 and 43), the
marks of the Rámánandis are two perpendicular white lines, drawn from
the root of the hair to the commencement of each eyebrow, and a transverse
streak connecting them across the root of the nose; in the centre is
a perpendicular streak of varied colours, besides other marks on the
breast and each upper arm.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_306" id="footnote_306"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_306"><span class="muchsmaller">[306]</span></a>
 The marks of the Madhwácharis, according to the same authority
(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 103), are the impress of the symbols of Vichnu upon their shoulders
and breasts, stamped with a hot iron, and the frontal mark, which consists
of two perpendicular lines, made with <dfn>Gopi chandana</dfn>, or the
sacred clay from Dwaraka, the city of Krichna, and joined at the root of
the nose; a straight black line is drawn down the centre with the charcoal
from the incense offered to Náráyana, terminating in a round mark
with turmeric.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_308"><span class="muchsmaller">[308]</span></a>
 See the work quoted, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 125-129. The members of this sect consider
a teacher named Hari Vans as their founder. This person settled at
Vrindavan, and established a math, or “convent,” there, which exists to
our days, and in 1822 comprised between forty and fifty resident ascetics.
He also erected a temple there that still exists, and indicates by an
inscription over the door that it was dedicated to Sri Rádhá Vallabha
by Hari Vans, Samvat 1641, or A. D. 1585. Rádha, the favourite mistress
of Krishna, is the object of adoration to these sectaries, who worship
Krishna as <dfn>Rádhá-Vallabah</dfn>, “the lord or lover of Rádhá,” whose
adoration Mr. Wilson thinks an undoubted innovation in the Hindu creed.
He says (<cite>ibid.</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 125): “The only Rádhá that is named in the Mahábharat
is a very different personage, being the wife of Duryodhana’s
charioteer, and the nurse of Karna. Even the Bhagavat makes no
particular mention of her amongst the Gopis of Vrindhavan, and we
must look to the Brahma Váivarta Purána (Krishna Janana Khanda)
as the chief authority of a classical character, on which the pretensions
of Rádhá are founded.” We know the difference of opinion
which exists among the Indianists about the antiquity to be attributed to
the Puranas, and which has not yet found a positive decision. It is
probably from the last mentioned Púráná that Jayadéva (see <a href="#footnote_304">note</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 180)
took the theme of his admirable poem, in which the love of Krichna
and Rádhá is described in the most glowing colours.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_309" id="footnote_309"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_309"><span class="muchsmaller">[309]</span></a>
 Rama, obliged to cede the throne to his brother Bharatta, having
on that account been banished by his father, lived with his wife Sitá, and
his younger brother Lakshmana upon the mountain Chitra Kotá, in Bundelkand,
whence he descended towards the south into the woods of Dandakam.
Every where he protected the Rishis, destroying their enemies,
the Rakshasas. The head of these was Rávaná, king of Lanka (Ceylon),
who, in order to take revenge of Rama, carried away by a successful
stratagem, Ráma’s beloved consort, Sîtá. The unfortunate husband, to
release his wife, concluded an alliance with Hanuman and Sugriva,
chiefs of the savage inhabitants, called monkies, of southern India, and
by their aid passed over to the island, took its capital, Lanka, and killed
the tyrant, Rávańa, in a battle. Sitá was released, but, for proving her
purity preserved, she underwent the ordeal of fire: it proved satisfactory;
her innocence was manifest to the multitude, but, it appears, not quite
so to the mind of her husband, who separated from her.</p>

<p class="footnote">Rámánuja Acharya was born at Perumbar, in the south of India, about
the end of the 11th century; his fame as a teacher was established about
the first half of the 12th century; he was a great supporter and propagator,
nay, the chief author, of the later Váishnava faith; he founded 700
maths, or “convents,” of which four only remain; but other establishments
of this sect are still numerous in the Dekhan.</p>

<p class="footnote">The worship of the followers of Rámánuja is addressed to Vichnu and
to Lakchmî, his wife, and to their respective incarnations, either singly
or conjointly; wherefore they are also named Srí Váichnavas, consisting
of several subdivisions. The chief religious tenet of the Rámánujas is
the assertion that Vichnu is Brahma; that he was before all worlds, and
was the cause and the creator of all. They maintain three predicates of
the universe comprehending the deity: it consists of <dfn>chit</dfn>, “spirit;”
<dfn>achit</dfn>, “matter;” and <dfn>Iśwára</dfn>, “God.”</p>

<p class="footnote">These sectaries are not allowed to eat in cotton garments, but, having
bathed, must put on woollen or silk, and their meal, whilst they are
eating, must not attract the eyes of a stranger, or it becomes instantly

are the same as those of the Rámánandis, before described (see
note, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 181), excepting that the central perpendicular streak on the
forehead is red, made with red sanders or roli, a preparation of turmeric
and lime. Besides other marks on their bodies, not enumerated here,
they wear a necklace of the wood of tulasi, and carry a rosary of the
seeds of the same plant, or of the lotus&mdash;(See, for a further account

 The most celebrated of the twelve distinguished disciples of Rámánandra
(see note, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 180) was <span class="person">Kabir</span>. I omit the miraculous circumstances
of his birth. He was taken up near Benares, a foundling, by the
wife of a weaver, named <span class="person">Nimá</span>, and brought up by her and her husband
<span class="person">Nuri</span>. Such is the uncertainty prevailing about Kabir’s time, that he is
placed by different authors within the space of not less than three centuries,
that is, from 1149 to 1449. According to Professor Wilson, he flourished
probably about the beginning of the 15th century. The philosophic
and religious notions of the Kabir Panthir are in substance the same
as those of the Pauranic sects, especially of the Váichnava division. They
admit but one God, the creator of the world, and, in opposition to the
Vedanta notions of the absence of every quality and form in him, they
assert that he has a body formed of the five elements of matter, and that
he is endowed with the three <dfn>gunas</dfn>, or qualities of being, of course of

<p class="footnote">The works attributed to Kabir himself, or to his disciples, are written
in the usual form of Hindi verse; twenty of them are enumerated in Professor
Wilson’s account of this sect (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 58 and 59), and appear very
voluminous.</p>

<p class="footnote">This sect is very widely diffused in India, and split into a variety of
subdivisions. At a great meeting near Benáres, no fewer than 35,000
Kabir-Panthis of the monastic and mendicant class are said to have been
collected. A place called “the Kabir Cháura,” at Benares, is an establishment
pre-eminent in dignity, and constantly visited by wandering
members of this sect, as well as by those of other kindred heresies: its
<dfn>Mahant</dfn>, or Superior, receives and feeds these visitors whilst they stay;
the establishment itself is supported by the occasional donations of its
lay-friends and followers&mdash;(See the work quoted, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 53-75).</p>

 According to Professor Wilson’s account (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 56-57), in the midst of
the dispute respecting the disposal of his corpse, Kabir himself appeared
amongst them, and having desired them to look under the cloth supposed
to cover his mortal remains, immediately vanished; on obeying
his instructions, they found nothing under the cloth but a heap of flowers;
one half of them the Hindus burnt in Benáres, and deposited the ashes in
a spot now called <span class="title">Kabir Chaura</span>, whilst the Muselmans erected a tomb
over the other portion at <span class="place">Magar</span>, near Gorakhpur, where Kabir died.</p>

They
say, out of these five skandhas just mentioned, there
is no other living principle, neither in man nor
brutes;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_325" id="fnanchor_325"></a><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span>
the world and its inhabitants have no
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
creator, and there is no maker: this is clear: because
whatever has not entered into the field of
manifestation, and has not broken into daylight,
cannot have the color of reality, and to be high or
low, proceeds from the nature of the universe;
whatever is written in the Vedas is not made public,
and besides may be a lie which rests upon no foundation;
and a lie certainly proceeds from the Vedas,
inasmuch as they perform <dfn>hóm</dfn>, which is a ceremony
in which they throw rice and like matters into the
fire, and recite prescribed prayers, saying that this
goes to the gods: now, whatever we throw into the
fire, after cremation, becomes ashes&mdash;how do these
go to the gods? It is also written in the Vedas, that
they are to make an offering of cooked meal to a
dead man&mdash;who is to enjoy it? For instance, when
a person is gone from village to village, from one
town to another, and in his absence a meal destined
for him is presented to another person, the stomach
of the former will not be filled. In the same manner,
when any thing is offered to a dead person, who,
according to the assumption of the followers of the
Vedas, has been translated to another world, what
honor and profit will accrue from it to him?</p>

<p>Thus is it also among the revelations of the Vedas,
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
that the depraved and criminal will be punished,
and the virtuous and holy associated to quietness
and satiated with prosperity: the one and the other
is a lie: because the vicious man is freed and alleviated
from the hardship of fasting, of bathing in
cold water, of subjection to pious practices, and
other inconveniences; whilst the virtuous, according
to the Vedas, is bound to all these troubles; further,
the wise ought to take his share of all the pleasures
and cultivate his happiness, because, once reunited
with earth, he will no more return.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i2a">“There is no return for thee; once gone, thou art gone.”</div>
</div>

<p>However, nobody is to hurt living beings, as by it
he is liable to cause some harm to himself. It is
agreed by the wise that no injury is to be done to
another; by the observance of which men may be
set at ease, their numbers increased, and cultivation
be promoted. This is the substance of the belief of
the Charvák.</p>

<p>We will explain it more clearly; their creed
is as follows: As the creator is not manifest, and
the comprehension of mankind cannot attain to
any certain knowledge about him, why should we
submit to the bondage of an object doubtful, imaginary,
if even wished for, yet not found; and why
should we, in temples and monasteries, rub our
foreheads on the ground, and present offerings to
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
deities whose reality, as all agree, will not stand
trial? And why, for the promise of heaven and
of future beatitude should we, like blockheads, abstain
from the abundance of desirable things, from
conveniences and blandishments? A wise man will
not give ready money for an adjourned good, and
deliver up place and power upon the lying accounts
of books, which eloquent men call Vedas, or heavenly
books; it is upon their authority that they extinguish
all desires in themselves, and press the necks of
men, like those of animals, in halters. We ought
not to be deceived; we ought not to believe what is
not evident. The frame of the body is composed of
four elements, which by the necessity of nature are
united harmoniously together; as long as the constitution
is firm and health flourishing, it is proper to
enjoy whatever is desirable by its nature, provided
no harm to living creatures arises from it; when the
frame falls asunder, the state to which the element
returns can only be the element; after the disjunction
of the bodily structure, there is no ascent to a
higher mansion, no beatitude or quietness, no descent,
or fire, or hell. These sectaries, when they
hear the Vedas recited, say jokingly: “These are
sick persons in a painful fit, or hired journeymen
in an uproar.” When they behold the zunar
(sacred thread) upon the neck of a Brahman, they
say: “A cow will not be without a rope.” When
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
they find a pious person watching by night, they say:
“He aspires to the dignity of an owl.” When they
encounter a hermit upon a mountain, they remark:
“He strives to outdo a bear.” When a person practises
the restraining of breath, they observe: “He
wishes to imitate a snake.” Of a person in a bath,
they say: “He chooses the dwelling of a fish or a
frog.” Moreover, when the Hindus relate that
Brahma, Vichnu, and Mahadéo, their three great
divinities, are the creator, the preserver, and the
destroyer of the world, they reply: “They represent
nothing else than the sexual organs.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_326" id="fnanchor_326"></a><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span>
Upon
Vichnu’s having four arms, they gloss: “At the time
of sexual intercourse, each man and woman has as
many.” To the praise of Mahadéo, from whose
head the river Ganges flowed, they subjoin the interpretation,
that “this means the virile organ in its
natural functions.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_327" id="fnanchor_327"></a><a href="#footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></span>
They meet the statement of
Brahma’s being the creator of things, with the reply:
“That this is an emblem of the birth of children:”
and they proffer many other speeches of a similar
import.</p>

<p class="footnote">I shall subjoin from Colebrooke’s treatise <cite>On the Philosophy of the
Hindus</cite> (<abbr title="Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, volume One, part One, page">Transact. R. A. S., vol. I. part I., p.</abbr> 561) the more correct denominations
and definitions of the five skandhas:</p>

<p class="footnote">1. <dfn>Rúpa-skandha</dfn>, comprehending organs of sense and their objects,
considered in relation to the person, or the sensitive and intelligent
faculty which is occupied with them.</p>

<p class="footnote">2. <dfn>Vijnnyána-skandha</dfn> consists in intelligence (<dfn>chitta</dfn>), which is the
same with self (<dfn>átman</dfn>) and (<dfn>vijnyána</dfn>) knowledge. It is consciousness
of sensation, or continuous course and flow of cognition and sentiment.
There is not any other agent, nor being, which acts and enjoys; nor is
there an eternal soul; but merely succession of thought, attended with
individual consciousness abiding within the body.</p>

<p class="footnote">3. <dfn>Védaná-skandha</dfn> comprises pleasure, pain, or the absence of either,
and other sentiments excited in the mind by pleasing or displeasing
objects.</p>

<p class="footnote">4. <dfn>Sanjnya-skandha</dfn> intends the knowledge or belief arising from
names or words: as ox, horse, etc.; or from indications or signs, as a
house denoted by a flag, and a man by his staff.</p>

<p class="footnote">5. <dfn>Sanskára-skandha</dfn> includes passions; as desire, hatred, fear, joy,
sorrow, etc.; together with illusion, virtue, vice, and every other modification
of the fancy or imagination. All sentiments are momentary.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_325" id="footnote_325"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_325"><span class="muchsmaller">[325]</span></a>
 Charvaka and his followers recognise perception as the only source
of knowledge. They know of no more than four elements, namely, earth,
water, fire, and wind, or air; and maintain that from a particular aggregation
of them in bodily organs there results sensibility and thought, as
the inebriating property is produced by the fermenting of several ingredients;
they deny the soul to be other than body.</p>

particular objects of the six senses;” so as seeing
with the eye, hearing with the ear, smelling with the
nose, tasting with the tongue, touching with the
hand, and perceiving with the mind; he who sees
is one, and that which is seen is another; so that
there is a seeing eye and a seen object, whatever is
seen, heard, smelled, tasted, touched, and impressed
upon the mind, corresponds respectively to each of
the six senses; and whatever is found by these six
senses, or the six objects, are called <span class="title">Shad-darsas</span>;

that is, “arguing:” so

it may be replied: “consequently it also emits no

that is, “wrangling;”

which means that

one pays no attention to his own position, but combats

“deceit;” this is

“futile argument;”
and this may be applied to a lying purpose: so
when one says that “sound is eternal,” because it
is created, as is the sky; both are the works of a
divinity; and whereas the sky is eternal, sound is
everlasting.</p>

or “subjugation;”

that is, when one wishes to be a conqueror at the

The
followers of this doctrine judge and affirm that, as
this world is created, there must be a Creator; the
<dfn>mukt</dfn> or “emancipation,” in their opinion means
striving to approach the origin of beings, not uniting
like the warp and the web, the threads of which,
although near, are nevertheless separate from each
other. This was related to me by the Imám Arastú,
who was a chief of the learned and said to me
that he had derived it from an old treatise upon
logic, the precepts of which were without explanation,
and to have bestowed on it that arrangement
under which it now exists amongst the learned: he
meant, probably, that the maxims are the same as
those extracted from the Tarka. The same doctrine
was taught in Greece: in confirmation of this, the
Persians say, that the science of logic which was
diffused among them was, with other sciences,
translated into the language of Yonia and Rumi, by
order of king Secander, the worshipper of science,
in the time of his conquest, and sent to Rúmi.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the eleventh: on the tenets held by the
followers of Buddha.</span>&mdash;These sectaries are also
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
called <span class="title">Jatis</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_369" id="fnanchor_369"></a><a href="#footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></span>
They have no belief in incarnations
or Avatárs of the Deity, but they admit the transmigration
of the soul into different bodies; they deny
several other dogmas of the Hindus; in their opinion,
nothing is more detestable than the doctrine of the
Brahmans, and when a misfortune befals any one of
them, they say: “Hast thou perchance done some
good to a Brahman,” or drunk some water of the
<span class="title">bone devourer</span>: so they call the Ganges, because the
Hindus, after the burning of the dead, throw their
bones into that river, and think it a meritorious act.
The Jatis take the greatest care of not hurting a living
being; on which account they do not like to pass
through water, for fear that an animal might come
under their feet. They eat no animal food, never
put their feet upon grass, and when they drink
water, they filter it first through a handkerchief or
a piece of cloth, that no living animal may remain in
it, and then steep this piece of cloth awhile in water,
in order that, if a living being stick thereto, it may
be separated, and take its place in the liquid. A
great number of the Baníans or traders are of this
sect; for the most part they sell corn, and some
get a livelihood as servants. The durvishes of this
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
class are called <span class="title">Srivaras</span> and <span class="title">Jatís</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_370" id="fnanchor_370"></a><a href="#footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></span>
They pluck the
hair of their head and beard by means of tweezers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_371" id="fnanchor_371"></a><a href="#footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></span>
When they travel, they carry a besom of the bark
of a soft tree with them, and out of regard for the
life of animals, they sweep the road with it before
they put down their feet, that no living insect may
be destroyed. When they speak, they hold a handkerchief
before their mouth, not to swallow a fly or
other insect.</p>

<p>They are frequently learned, and pass their life
in celibacy and sanctity; these they call <span class="title">Jatis</span>, who
never behold the face of a woman. Those of this
sect who are married, called <span class="title">Grihast’ha</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_372" id="fnanchor_372"></a><a href="#footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></span>
show great
regard for the Jatis, before whom, by a refinement
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
of respect, they scarce dare bend their body. Whenever
they receive a Jati in their house, they do whatever
he orders, according to their power. They
are divided into two classes: the <span class="title">Lunugí</span> and <span class="title">Pujáris</span>.
The first are those who adore God as one, and
think him free from all imperfections and contradictions,
descents and conjunctions, and who worship
no idol. The <span class="title">Pujáris</span> venerate the image of a
deity, and have temples for it. The durvishes of
both classes, called Jatis, at the time of taking meals,
go into the houses of friends, and take only as much
food as may not cause a privation to the people of
the house: thus they visit several houses until they
get satiated. They drink no cold water, but go
from place to place, and wherever any body has
warm water for bathing, they take a little of it, and
having thus collected sufficient water, they let it
cool and then drink it.</p>

<p>Similar to the durvi&nbsp;hes of both classes is a third
sect, called <span class="title">Mahá-átma</span>; they have the dress and
appearance of Jatis; only they do not pluck their
hair with tweezers, but cut it. They accumulate
money, cook their meal in their houses, drink cold
water, and take to them a wife. Farzánah Khushí
says: I saw, in Guzerat of the Panjab, a Śrivara, and
requested him to give me a full account, which may
be deemed true beyond any doubt, of the people of his
sect. He related as follows: “The men of my faith
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
may live retired from the world, or devoted to business;
they do no harm to any body; but there
are many of them eager for science, and as many
bereft of knowledge.” One of the Maha-átmas was
a learned man; the wife of a rich man devoted herself
to his service; one day she complained to him of
the unkindness of her husband; the Śrivara gave no
answer; wherefore the woman said: “Another time
I will not wait on thee, because thou takest no
interest in me.” The Śrivara rejoined: “If
even thy visit were agreeable to me, it would be
of no service to thee.” He then took up a bit of
grass, and having breathed upon it, gave it to the
woman, saying: “Put on a clean garment, and
having ground the grass, rub it upon thy garment
until thy husband becomes kind to thee.”
The woman returned to her house, and having
ground the grass upon a stone, intended to rub it
upon her garment, when the husband entered into
the room, therefore the grass she had ground remained
upon the stone. When night fell in, they shut
the door of the house. The stone at every moment
jumped from its place, knocked against the board of
the door, and fell back: the woman and her husband
were astonished. The man asked his wife the
reason of it, and she, from fear, told him what had
taken place. The man rose and opened the door of
the house; the stone was set in motion, and rolled
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
on until it reached the house of the Mahá-átma.
Many other similar stories are told of the Srívaras.
Khushi said that he had seen the Jati
just mentioned, who by the power of incantation
put stones into motion; he praised him, but declared
that this man was really a Jati, but not a
Mahá-átma.</p>

<p>The author of this book affirms he has seen a great
number of Srivaras and their followers. From them
he knew <span class="person">Meher chand</span>, a <span class="title">Lúnú</span>, in the year 1056 of the
Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the
dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva
rama, a Pujári, in Mírta, which place belongs to Marawar,
and one named <span class="person">Jagna</span>, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi:
he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis.
When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he
bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever
they can for the liberation of living beings.
Many of them are rájas in several places and countries.
When one brings a goat which he has bought
somewhere, and is disposed to kill it, they come
from their shops and buy the animal at a high price;
thus it has been seen that, having assembled from
<a name="reversed" id="reversed"></a>all hands a great number of sheep, they appointed a
person to take care of them. It is said, that in Guzerat
lived a Banian who was a Jati; one day, a Muselman
Durvish sat down before his shop, and having
picked vermin from his coat, was about to kill it;
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
the Banian interposed; the Durvish said: “If thou
wilt give me something, I may spare it;” the
Banian offered a <em>pie</em>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_373" id="fnanchor_373"></a><a href="#footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></span>
the other wanted more and
more, until the bargain closed with the sum of one
hundred rupees, which the Banian paid for the
liberation of the offensive insect. Hafiz Shirázi says:</p>

apply more properly to the <span class="title">Jainas</span>, that is, to one of the great divisions

 In the <a href="#footnote_316">note</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 195, are mentioned the <span class="title">Jatis</span>, or <span class="title">Yatis</span>, also called
<span class="title">Sévras</span> among the Jainas of Guzerat and Marwar. According to the
same authority (<abbr title="Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society">Transact. R. A. S.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume Three page">vol. III. p.</abbr> 344), these are distinguished
from the <span class="title">Sravakas</span>, as the laity of the Jainas are called in that
country. According to Major de la Maine (work quoted, <abbr title="volume One page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 413),
the Sravacs are the only considerable part of the earlier Jains or Arhats.
“Sravakas,” says Doctor Buchanan Hamilton (<cite>ibid.</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 531), “is the
name given to the Jains in the districts of Bahar and Patna.” The three
authors just quoted agree in stating that the priests of the Sravakas are
called Yatis. The Dabistan reads <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">سريوره</span>, <span class="trans">Srivarah</span>, which may be

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the twelfth: on various religious systems
professed by the people of India.</span>&mdash;It is to be
recollected that, as has been stated, there are Samradíán,
Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán,
Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and Mazdakían,
who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and
all appear in the dress of Muselmans, although in
secret they follow each the path of their own chosen
faith; in the same manner various sects are also
established in India, but they do not appear in the
dress of Muselmans. It is to be known, that the
fundamental rule in the creed of the Hindus is the
<dfn>Smriti</dfn>, that is, the “law,” and that all Rakshasas,
that is, “devotees,” follow this way; the Véda,
to them the heavenly book, prescribes the acts, and
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
is a text, from which every sect may derive proofs
of its particular belief, and all may agree in some
points.</p>

<p>I have already given an account of their religion,
but I must here remind the reader of some points.
They say Naránaya, that is, “the deity,” in the origin
was alone; a flower, namely, the lotus, having
a thousand leaves, rose from his navel, from which
Brahma came forth, Brahma <dfn>chatur mukha</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_374" id="fnanchor_374"></a><a href="#footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></span>
or “four
faced;” one of these faces was cut off by Máhadéo;
Brahma is also <dfn>ashta báhu</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_375" id="fnanchor_375"></a><a href="#footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></span>
that is “eight
armed;” in his navel was also a flower of five hundred
leaves, from which Vichnu proceeded; Vichnu
<dfn>chatur báhu</dfn>, or “four armed;” he carries in one hand
a spear; in the other, the <dfn>chakra</dfn>, “the discus,” a
weapon peculiar to the Hindus; in the third hand,
the <dfn>gadá</dfn>, or “club;” and, in the fourth, the lotus
flower. In the navel of Vichnu was a lotus of one
hundred leaves, from which sprang Mahadéo, who
is <dfn>ashtamukha</dfn>, or “eight faced” and “eight armed;”
he rides upon a bull, his neck is surrounded by a
snake, the hide of an elephant envelops him, and
his body is rubbed with ashes; <dfn>chandra</dfn>, “the moon,”
<dfn>surya</dfn>, “the sun,” and <dfn>agni</dfn>, or “fire,” are his three
eyes. The sect of <span class="title">Sáivas</span> adore Mahadéo, and his
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
wife is worshipped by the <span class="title">Akmían</span> and <span class="title">Ashnían</span>, as
before shown.</p>

<p>Another sect is that of the Sanyásis, who are
praised in the Smriti; they distinguish themselves
by long and entangled hair, which is called <span class="title">jata</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_376" id="fnanchor_376"></a><a href="#footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></span>
The Saiva-Sanyásis are also called <span class="title">Avadutas</span>; their
numbers increased during the Kaliyug; they are
very pious, intrepid, and charitable. At one time,
a war broke out between them and the Sófís: the
former were victorious.</p>

<p>Another sect is that of the <span class="title">Jangaman</span>; these also
cut the hair off their heads, they rub dust upon their
bodies, and praise Mahadéo, to whom they attribute
a real existence. They are divided into several
classes. They say, among the celestial spirits are
nine Brahmas, who are the <dfn>anśus</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_377" id="fnanchor_377"></a><a href="#footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></span>
that is, “the
rays” of Brahma. There are one thousand
Vichnus, rays of Vichnu, who is also called <span class="title">Naráyana</span>;
there are eleven <dfn>Rudras</dfn>, rays of Rudra, which
is a name of Mahádeo; they reckon twelve suns,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_378" id="fnanchor_378"></a><a href="#footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></span>
rays of the great luminary; sixteen <dfn>kalas</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_379" id="fnanchor_379"></a><a href="#footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></span>
that is,
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
parts or rays of the moon; and they divide the effulgence
of that body into sixteen parts, and enumerate
eight and twenty of its mansions, or <dfn>nakshatras</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_380" id="fnanchor_380"></a><a href="#footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></span>
and
seven planets, besides the head and tail of the dragon.
Ganesa is to them a god with the head of an
elephant. They distinguish eight quarters of the
world, besides the zenith and nadir, and call them
<dfn>asht dísa</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_381" id="fnanchor_381"></a><a href="#footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></span>
in the following order: <dfn>purva</dfn>, “east;”
<dfn>paśchima</dfn>, “west;” <dfn>dakchina</dfn>, “south;” and <dfn>uttara</dfn>,
“north;” between south and east, <dfn>agni</dfn>; between
south and west, <dfn>náirrita</dfn>; between north and west,
<dfn>váyu</dfn>, between north and east, <dfn>íśána</dfn>. Among the
deities are <dfn>Bhaírava</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_382" id="fnanchor_382"></a><a href="#footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></span>
and <dfn>Hanuman</dfn>, and among
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
female spirits <dfn>asht Durgás</dfn>, or “eight Durgás,” in
the following order: <dfn>Kálaká</dfn>, <dfn>Chandra Kálanjarí</dfn>, <dfn>Káumarí</dfn>,
<dfn>Váichnaví</dfn>, <dfn>Bábhraví</dfn>, <dfn>Chamundá</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_383" id="fnanchor_383"></a><a href="#footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></span>

<dfn>Maha Lakchmî Sarasvatí</dfn> is the wife of
Brahma. <dfn>Rakshasas</dfn> are termed the pious men of
the Satya yug; <dfn>Kaśyapa</dfn> is the father of the sun;

<p>It is to be known that there is a class among the
Hindus who give themselves the term of Muselman-sofis,
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
and really agree in several tenets and
opinions with the Sufís. Thus, in the first place,
they devote themselves to celibacy. As they have
heard that there are ten classes of Sanyásís, and
twelve of Yogís, they also pretend to be divided into
fourteen classes; when they meet together, the questions
which they ask are: Who are the four sages,
and which are the fourteen noble families? and they
impose upon their disciples many years of service,
before they reveal to them the four sages and the
fourteen families; they say: The sage of sages is the
illustrious Muhammed (may the peace of God be
upon him!); after him, devoted to godliness, Ali (may
the blessing of God be upon him!); from him the
khalifat devolved upon Imam Hossain; then Khaja
Hossen, of Basora, also was his disciple and a khalif:
these four personages are the four sages. They
say besides, from Khaja Hossen, of Basora, sprang
two branches: the first was that of the khalif Hossen
Basorí Habíb Ajemí, from whom nine families
proceeded, named as follows: the <span class="title">Jíbíán</span>, <span class="title">Táikeríán</span>,
<span class="title">Kerkhíán</span>, <span class="title">Sikatíán</span>, <span class="title">Jenídíán</span>, <span class="title">Gazrúníán</span>, <span class="title">Túsíán</span>, <span class="title">Ferdusíán</span>,
and <span class="title">Soherwardíán</span>. From the second khalifat
of Hossen Basori, which was that of the Shaikh
Abdul Wahid Zaid, came forth five families with
the following titles: the <span class="title">Zebírían</span>, <span class="title">Aiáśían</span>, <span class="title">Adhamían</span>,
<span class="title">Habírían</span>, and <span class="title">Cheshtíán</span>: and these are the
fourteen noble families. It is said, that there exists
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">222</span>
a congregation of pious sectaries, who do not adhere
to the prophet Muhammed, although they acknowledge
him to be a blessed gatherer of the harvest of
virtuous perfection: they relate, that one day the
prophet was taking a pleasure-walk under the guidance
of Jabríl, and came to a place where a great
tumult was heard. Jabril said: “This is the
threshold of pleasure: enter into the house.”
The prophet consented to go in, and there he saw
sitting forty persons as naked as they came from
their mother, and a band busy serving; but whatever
service the prophet requested them to command
him to do, they did not comply, until the moment to
grind <dfn>bang</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_387" id="fnanchor_387"></a><a href="#footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></span>
arrived. When they had ground it,
they had no cloth through which they could strain
and purify it; then the prophet, having taken his
turban from his head, purified through it the juice of
the bang, the color of which remained on the turban;
whence the garment of the Biní Hashem is green.
When the prophet rendered them this service, they
were glad, and said among themselves: “Let us
give to this messenger of God, who is always
running to the door of the ignorant, a little of
the bang, that he may obtain the secrets of the
Almighty power:” so they gave the remains of the
juice to the prophet. When he had drunk it, he
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
became possessed of the secrets of the angel of destiny,
and whatever men heard from him, came
through the means of this bounty.</p>

<p>There is a great number of this sect in Hindostan,
and among the most celebrated of them are, in the
first line, the <span class="title">Madárían</span>, who, like the Sanyásís
<span class="title">Avadhuts</span>, wear the hair entangled; and the ashes
which they and the Sanyásis rub upon their bodies
are called <span class="title">bhasma</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_388" id="fnanchor_388"></a><a href="#footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></span>
besides, they carry iron chains
on their heads and necks, and have black flags
and black turbans; they know neither prayers nor
fasts; they are always sitting at a fire; they drink a
great deal of bang; and the most perfect among
them go about without any dress, in severe cold, in
Kabul, and Kachmir, and such places. These also
consume much bang, and to the praise of one of their
sect they say: “Such a one takes two or three <dfn>seers</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_389" id="fnanchor_389"></a><a href="#footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></span>
of bang.” When they sit together, they relate, that
in the night, when the prophet ascended through
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
the seven stages of heaven, he received the command
of God to wander through the heavens. When he
arrived at the door of paradise, he found the entrance
as narrow as the eye of a needle; the porter
made him a sign to enter; the prophet said: “With
this body, how shall I enter through this passage?”
Jabríl replied: “Say: <dfn>dam madar</dfn>,” (“the
breath of Madar,” a particular ejaculation of
this sect). The prophet said so, upon which the
narrow door opened, and he entered heaven.</p>

<p>They say, when Badih eddin Madar<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_390" id="fnanchor_390"></a><a href="#footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span>
came to Hindostan,
he became a Yogi, whom the Hindus held in
great esteem, and who had a great number of followers.
Madar took a house; he sent a little boy,
whose name was Jamen, with the order to fetch
some dry cowdung with which he wanted to kindle
a fire. It so happened that Jamen fell in with an
assembly of Yogis, who, supposing him a Muselman,
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
killed, cut into pieces, and devoured the boy.
Some time after, not receiving any thing to light up
his fire, Madár went in search of Jamen, and found
the assembly of Yogis, to whom he said: “What
have you done with my good little boy?” They
answered: “We have not seen him.” Madár called
him loud by his name, and the members of Jamen,
from within the bodies of the assembled Yogis,
answered “<cite>Dam madar</cite>.” Madár then said to the
Yogis: “Shall I bring forth Jamen from you all, or
from one only of you?” They replied: “From
one body only.” By the power of Madár, the
limbs of the boy having united, in a manner that no
body perceived any thing of it, in the belly of the
principal Yogi, Jamen fell out from the nose of the
same, so that neither the nostril of the Yogi’s nose
was enlarged, nor the boy’s limbs diminished:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_391" id="fnanchor_391"></a><a href="#footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></span>
whereupon the Yogis chose to run away. Madár
settled at this place, which till now is known by the
name of <span class="title">Makanpúr</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_392" id="fnanchor_392"></a><a href="#footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></span>
The Madarían come, as many
as possible, from all parts of the world, once a year,
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
on a fixed day, to Makanpur, and say that the blind
and lame find their cure in that place.</p>

<p>They relate also, that <span class="person">Chistápá</span>, the wife of Baharam
Gul, in order to put to the test the Muhammedan
and Indian durvishes and saints, came once
among them who were assembled, and said: “Whoever
will loosen the bracelet of beads (called <span class="title">Sámran</span>)
upon my arm, without betraying the least
symptom of lust, he is a perfect saint.” All the
pretenders to perfect sanctity, Muselmans and Hindus,
presented themselves, but at the sight of Chistapa,
they all were maddened with love, such was
the beauty of her face: at last the turn came to
Jamen, who approached her, and loosened the bracelet
in a manner which, at the same time, evinced
his manly strength, and his complete command over
himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_393" id="fnanchor_393"></a><a href="#footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></span>
On that account, Jamen was proclaimed
victorious over all the Muselmans and Hindus. And
they have a great number of other similar stories.</p>

<p>Another sect, the <span class="title">Jelalían</span>, are disciples of <span class="person">Said
Jelal</span>, of Bokhára;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_394" id="fnanchor_394"></a><a href="#footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></span>
his sepulchre is in the village
<span class="place">Auch</span>, in the district of <span class="place">Sind</span>; these sectaries profess
to be Shíáhs, whilst the Medárían are <span class="title">Sunís</span>, on
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
which account they revile each other. The former
know of neither prayers nor fasts, nor any other
practices of piety with which the Sufís are occupied;
they take a great deal of bang, and used to eat snakes
and scorpions. When the adepts among them see
a snake, they put it whole into their mouth and
swallow it, saying: “This is a fish of the holy Alí;”
in eating a scorpion they remark: “This is a prawn
of Alí:” and the worms which are found in the
water, they call the little crabs of Alí. Like the Medárian,
the Jelalían go naked, and even in the severely
cold season, wear no garment; they sit before the
fire like the Medárian, but do not wear matted hair;
frequently they shave four parts of their body, and
lead a wandering life in the world. Some of them
bring every thing that they gain to their master, and
when they go for instruction to a preceptor, they
deliver to him whatever they possess in ready money
and other property; after which he presents them
with a turban, and his list of saints; they wear that
on their heads, and hang this on their necks. They
believe that, when Jzráíl comes to take their soul,
the turban, descending, covers their eyes so that
they may not behold the face of the angel of death,
which is exceedingly terrific. Their master looks
every day for a new connexion with a woman;
whenever he knows of a fine girl among his disciples,
he orders trumpets to be blown, goes on
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
horseback, and betaking himself to their house,
uses his own discretion with the girl, whom he now
and then takes to his own house, but never marries.
The author of this book asked one of the Jelális:
“Hámed Mahommed, your master, does he take
the daughter of one of his disciples without marrying
her?” He answered: “The Safavian kings
too take wives, daughters, and sons of their disciples,
who are highly pleased with it, why should
not Hámed Mahommed, who is truly the Khalif
(substitute) of Alí, do the same?” This act is a
sign of sovereignty, and a prerogative of the family
of the prophet. In this country are many of his
disciples, and he is a very great friend to hunting.</p>

<p>There is another sect who call themselves without
tie and food; it is a laudable conduct with them to
take nothing from any body beyond the required
food and drink; and for their indispensable clothing,
from the shreds which they find in the streets to
stick together a coat, which they call <span class="title">kherka</span>; and
when they ask something from any body, they first
revile him and call him bad names, wherefore they
often receive bad treatment from the people. They
say, God is a spirit, and Muhammed his body; his
four friends are his two arms and two feet; <dfn>dam
mádar</dfn>, that is, Mádar, is the breath and the spirit of
God. They drink many sorts of spirituous and
intoxicating liquors. They believe the unity of the
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
divine being, and some of them are also pious men.
Their master was <span class="person">Gada Naráyana</span>. The three just
mentioned sects never shed the blood of animated
beings.</p>

<p>Another sect, called <span class="title">Kakan</span>, is in Kachmir; celibacy
is their law, and their belief the unity of the
divine being. They use much bang; a number of
them is devoted to piety; their name of “Kakan” is
derived from that of their master, who was Ibrahim
Kakak. He lived, they say, in the time of the Pádshah
Jehangír, who inhabits heaven, and drew to
him whomever he chose; his very sight was such
an attraction, that he on whom it fixed was irresistibly
thrown at his feet; thus he attached to himself
a great number of disciples, Hindus and Muselmans,
none of whom he induced to change his
religion; that is to say, to the Hindu he did not
expound the Koran, nor propose circumcision; and
to the Muselman he did not make an obligation of
the Zunar, and of the mark of caste upon the forehead;
neither the praise of Muselmans nor the blame
of Hindus came ever upon his tongue; he never
pronounced either the name of the prophet or that
of an Avatar, which are the great objects of veneration
to the Muselmans and to the Hindus; but he
uttered <cite>Ruma</cite>, or <cite>Alla</cite>, or <cite>Khoda</cite>. He did not sleep
at night, nor did his disciples, who sat back to back
until morning before him. At a place of Kachmir,
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
he said to his followers: “A great number of men
laid down; let us do the same.” The followers
answered: “Let it be as you say:” he then first
laid himself down to sleep, and the friends did the
same. One day he heard the voice of a crier from
the top of a minaret, and said: “This is the voice
of God;” at this moment one of his companions
broke wind; he subjoined: “This too is God; this
too the divine tongue.” A student present said
to him: “Do not blaspheme.” He replied: “The
one and the other is an undulation of the air, and
the air is subject to God.” The student reassumed:
“But the bad smell, with the noise, what
is it?” The answer was: “This proceeds from
the association of ‘<cite>thou and I</cite>.’” The student
said farther: “Drink no bang, because the bang-drinkers
shall not pass over the bridge of judgment
(<span class="title">sarat´h</span>).” Kakak replied: “Great is the
number of bang-drinkers; let us, on this side of
the bridge, build a town and call it <span class="title">Bang pur</span>, and
not think of passing the bridge.” Goya Kásem
composed a ludicrous account of these drunken
sectaries. When the king <span class="person">Kásem Anwar</span> (distributor
of splendors) was near the habitation of excellence,
he recited the following verses:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“He (God) distributes the light; I distribute bang,</div>
 <div class="i0">He is the distributor of splendors; I, the distributor of secrets.”</div>
</div>

<p>A great number of men in India think as these
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
sectaries. The Sanyásis assembled once in one of
the sacred places of pilgrimage revered by the Hindus;
by accident, an army of naked Jelális and
Madáris came there at the same time, and having
brought a cow, wanted to kill it; the Sanyásis bought
the cow from them; they came a second time, with
another cow, which the Sanyásis again, not without
entreaties, purchased. These men, barefoot and
bareheaded, having become insolent by their numbers,
brought a third cow and killed it; the Sanyásis,
indignant at this, attacked them, and a battle ensued,
in which the Sanyásis at last obtained the victory,
and killed seven hundred of the naked Jelális and
Madáris; they educated the boys of these fanatics,
whom they made prisoners on this occasion, in their
own religion. The Sanyásis were frequently seen
engaged in war.</p>

<p>Another class of the Hindus are the <span class="title">Yógis</span>, who
pretend to a high antiquity; an account of them has
already been given.</p>

<p>Other sects, such as the <span class="title">Sankhyan</span>, and the <span class="title">Patanjálís</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_395" id="fnanchor_395"></a><a href="#footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></span>
are devoted to piety, and practise the <span class="title">yóga</span>,
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
and other pious austerities; also the <span class="title">Charvakíán</span>, who
believe the four classes of their sect to be very
ancient: we have already treated of them, as well as
of the <span class="title">Játis</span> and <span class="title">Vairágis</span>; the <span class="title">Nanak Panthíán</span> will be
introduced hereafter.</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Narayaníán</span> are a sect of the Hindus, which
holds its creed from <span class="person">Gosáin Haridas</span>. He was of the
tribe of <span class="title">Játs</span>, from the village <span class="place">Kaníra</span>, in the district
of <span class="place">Saválik</span>; he was a servant of <span class="person">Nabidás Sanyálá</span>;
which last name is that of a tribe of the numerous
Rájaputs. Haridas, when hunting, shot an arrow at
a deer which was with young, and brought down a
fawn, which had also been pierced by the arrow.
At the sight of this event, Haridas broke his bow
and arrows, tore his garment into pieces, weeping
and bewailing, and during twelve years had no intercourse
with the society of men. Afterwards, he
assembled many disciples about him. He died in
the year 1055 of the Hejira (1645 A. D.). This sect
know nothing of idols, nor of temples, nor of the
Kâbah, nor of any sort of worship; they do nothing
towards obtaining the knowledge of, or union with,
God; they confine themselves to the veneration of
<dfn>Naráyan</dfn>, or “the supreme Being,” from which they
derive the name of <span class="title">Naráyanían</span>. They do not occupy
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
themselves with the affairs of the world; abnegation
and solitude is their law. Some have an earthen
cup to drink water in; some dispense even with
this; they hurt no living being; they never pull up
any grass or green herbs; they burn nothing; cook
no meal; and when hungry, they go into the houses
of the Hindus, and accept some food, but no flesh
of any sort of animal. When one of them is about
to die, he is asked: “Shall we burn thy body, or
throw it into the water, or bury it in the earth?”
Whichever he desires is done.</p>

<p>Another sect is that of the <span class="title">Dádu Panthians</span>. Dádu
was one of the cotton carders in the village Naráina,
in the district of Marwar. In the time of the
Padshah Akbár (who inhabits heaven!) Dádu devoted
himself to the state of a Durvesh, and assembled
many disciples about him. He prohibited his
followers to worship idols, to eat the flesh of any
animal, or to hurt any living being; but he did not
order them to abandon woman and wife, or to withdraw
from all business of the world; but he left it
free to any one to give up, or to cultivate, the connection
and intercourse with men. When one of
them dies, they place his corpse upon the back of a
quadruped, and send it into the desert, saying: “It
is now better that rapacious and other animals
may be satiated with it.”</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Píára panthíán</span> hold their creed from <span class="title">Bábá</span>
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">234</span>
<span class="title">Píára</span>; at the time of begging, they stand before the
shops and houses, without looking at any body
or saying any thing; they demand nothing with the
tongue; they accept what is given, and go away
when nothing is offered. The Mobed says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“The demand without the tongue is made by the eyes;</div>
 <div class="i0">How can that which is heard be equivalent to what is seen?”</div>
</div>

<p>They take no notice of the Muselmans, although
they so call themselves.</p>

<p>The sect of the Vishnavas follow the doctrine of
Gosáin Jáni. We hold the information from Jogendas,
that they called their master <span class="title">Jehan</span>, and his followers,
composed of Hindus and Muselmans, adopted
the creed of Vishnavi. This is as follows: they
hurt no living being; they avoid fellowship with
men of another creed among the Hindus and Muselmans;
they pray five times a-day, with their face
towards the east; they have the names of God, of
the divinities, of the prophet upon their lips, such
as <span class="title">Allah</span>, <span class="title">Míkáíl</span>, <span class="title">Jzráíl</span>, <span class="title">Jibrail</span>, <span class="title">Muhammed</span>, <span class="title">Jl</span>, and
others; they bury their dead; they confer benefits
upon others to the extent of their power; a number
of their Durvishes pretend to be afflicted with
maladies and beg alms, and whatever they so collect
they distribute to the blind and lame, and to
people of that description.</p>

<p>Further to be noticed is the sect of the <dfn>Surya-mak-han</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_396" id="fnanchor_396"></a><a href="#footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></span>
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">235</span>
that is, of “the worshippers of the sun.”
These derive their origin from an ancient nation of
Hindus, and are divided into two classes. The one
of them says: The great luminary is one of the
divinities of the first rank; he has <dfn>átmá</dfn> and <dfn>buddhi</dfn>,
that is, “soul and intellect;” the light of the stars
and the splendor of the universe proceeds from
him; he is the <dfn>asht bhuvana loka</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_397" id="fnanchor_397"></a><a href="#footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></span>
that is, “the origin
of the eight worlds,” and of all earthly beings;
the <dfn>sarva prabhá deva</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_398" id="fnanchor_398"></a><a href="#footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></span>
“the God of all radiance,”
the chief and ruler of all divinities, the deity of heavens,
the king of the stars; the <dfn>Mahajyóti</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_399" id="fnanchor_399"></a><a href="#footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></span>
or “the
great light,” worthy of praise; and of <dfn>namaskara</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_400" id="fnanchor_400"></a><a href="#footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></span>
that is “respectful salutation,” and of adoration;
and of <dfn>hóm</dfn>, or “sacrificial perfumes.” When the
sun rises with his pure body, they stand opposite
to him, and after adoration recite a Sanskrit prayer,
the paraphrase of which is as follows:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_401" id="fnanchor_401"></a><a href="#footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></span>
“Whatever
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
beautiful light and high splendor thou possessest
overflows the eyes from the excessive bounty of
thy manifestation; thou art that light which is
not surpassed by any other in the display of
splendors; thine is the first prayer, for thou art
the substitute of God, and we place our hope in
thy bounty; to thee we address the prayers of our
wants, that we may experience and loudly proclaim
thy mercy. When this light is thy face,
whatever we can say of the splendor, the beauty,
and perfection of the supreme intellectual soul and
of the pure wisdom, is but that one light which
we recognise above in thy bountiful being, which
thou temperest and displayest; this light derives
its glory from thee, and supplication is due to this
light. Give us thy assistance in the abnegation
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
of worldly pleasures; render us equal to thyself
in the purity of light, and by thy knowledge
grant us union with thee; the wish of all virtuous
hearts is, that they may, far removed from
all sensual delights, be made happy in the communion
with those who are like thee: we abandon
all worldly delights, that we may become
similar to thee in splendor, and arrive to thee, and
remain with thee.”</p>

<p>The other class of the <span class="title">Suryamakhan</span> say: Whatever
exists in the <dfn>Swargaloka</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_402" id="fnanchor_402"></a><a href="#footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></span>
and in the <dfn>Bhúloka</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_403" id="fnanchor_403"></a><a href="#footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></span>
that is, in the upper and lower world, draws its
origin from the sovereign great luminary; by his
glorious appearance we fill our <dfn>lojáni</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_404" id="fnanchor_404"></a><a href="#footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></span>
or “eyes,”
with <dfn>kalyanum</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_405" id="fnanchor_405"></a><a href="#footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></span>
or “auspicious light;” and we hear
the <dfn>Sanákáras</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_406" id="fnanchor_406"></a><a href="#footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></span>
that is, “the incorporeal beings;” by
him we acquire <dfn>buddhi</dfn>, that is “intellect,” the professor
of which attaches his heart to nothing exterior:
on that account they call the sun <dfn>natha</dfn>, “a
sovereign, or divine being,” and pay worship to
him. Both classes abstain from hurting living
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">238</span>
beings, and are on that account called <span class="title">jiva dayá</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_407" id="fnanchor_407"></a><a href="#footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></span>
“compassionate of life;” they do good to others as
much as they can, wherefore they are termed <dfn>punyavantas</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_408" id="fnanchor_408"></a><a href="#footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></span>
“virtuous;” they keep far away from falsehood
and iniquity, for which they are entitled <span class="title">dharmamayás</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_409" id="fnanchor_409"></a><a href="#footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></span>
“righteous.” The <dfn>gríhastha</dfn>, or “householder,”
contents himself with one <dfn>strí</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_410" id="fnanchor_410"></a><a href="#footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></span>
or “wife.”
They divide the sun into several parts, which they
call <dfn>dyuvá murtayas</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_411" id="fnanchor_411"></a><a href="#footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></span>
“figures of the sun;” but the
first class reckons among the <dfn>Pandits</dfn>, or “learned,”
an order of men who have a system about <dfn>ákása</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_412" id="fnanchor_412"></a><a href="#footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></span>
“ether,” <dfn>girayas</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_413" id="fnanchor_413"></a><a href="#footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></span>
“mountains,” <dfn>tárá phal</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_414" id="fnanchor_414"></a><a href="#footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></span>
“starry
firmament;” about the rising of heavenly bodies
and the prognostics which are connected with them;
they possess perfectly the canons of the <dfn>Véda anga</dfn>,
“sacred science,” in which the medical is comprised;
and they set a great value upon <dfn>buddhí</dfn>,
“intellect;” and <dfn>áharanam</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_415" id="fnanchor_415"></a><a href="#footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></span>
that is, “the application
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
of the thinking faculty;” and they say, that
this is the mediator between what is <dfn>sankhyanam</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_416" id="fnanchor_416"></a><a href="#footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></span>
“rational,” or probable, and <dfn>sadhanam</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_417" id="fnanchor_417"></a><a href="#footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></span>
“substantiated,”
which last is the form of things perceived;
and the right appreciation of probabilities is
attained by dint of <dfn>buddhi</dfn> and <dfn>aharanam</dfn>, that is, by
high intelligence; this is fixing the thought of contemplation;
or arriving at the science of what is
perceived and what is probable or rational; this
comprehends properly two sciences which are possessed
by the <dfn>jitèndriya loka</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_418" id="fnanchor_418"></a><a href="#footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></span>
that is, “by those
sages who have subdued the senses.”</p>

<p>There is a class of durvishes who practise <dfn>tapasya</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_419" id="fnanchor_419"></a><a href="#footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></span>
or “devout austerity,” and who, by great and difficult
penances, banish every illusion from them, so
that in their sleep they may not have unbecoming
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
dreams, which they say are produced by the influence
of the imagination; and they guard their eyes
from the wounds and impressions which also proceed
from the imagination. They climb up to the
tops of walls, without fear of falling down, and go
to such places as are not easily accessible, which
they say is a triumph over illusion; they pretend to
have the power to cause rain to fall or to cease; to
attract whomever they like, and to render him obedient
to their will; to give information of whatever
is concealed, and to reveal the secrets of the heart;
to possess the knowledge of the good and the bad
hidden in the minds; as well as that of the relations
and history of the world; and upon the
mirror of their hearts are reflected the lights of
secrets, the <dfn>djoti mandalam</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_420" id="fnanchor_420"></a><a href="#footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></span>
“the splendor of the
universe.” When a misfortune happens, all the
pious men assemble and hold council about the
removal of it; they investigate the strange and astonishing
events; they keep day and night their eyes
shut, and, pondering, exercise their sagacity: these
are called <span class="title">Dhyani</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_421" id="fnanchor_421"></a><a href="#footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></span>
Those who are not occupied
with exterior things are called <span class="title">tyagî</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_422" id="fnanchor_422"></a><a href="#footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></span>
and others
who shun all intercourse with women and have no
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
wife, take the title of <span class="title">Yatis</span>; and there is a class who,
with the same abnegation as the former, never mix
with the people of the world, and never ask more
from them than a small quantity of food: these are
called <span class="title">Vaíragîs</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_423" id="fnanchor_423"></a><a href="#footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></span>
or <span class="title">Udasîs</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_424" id="fnanchor_424"></a><a href="#footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></span>
Others live in deserts
and upon mountains, satisfied with fruits; the savage
animals do them no harm; they are named <span class="title">Vanyasîs</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_425" id="fnanchor_425"></a><a href="#footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></span>
When, among them, a child is born or a marriage
takes place in the house of a family-man, they
do not offer him their congratulation; and when a
misfortune occurs, such as the death of a friend,
they do not grieve or take mourning. A desire for
generation, and a relish for meat and drink, inasmuch
as may be requisite, is permitted, but beyond
this prohibited; and whoever desires more is excluded
from their society. This order of men among
them is called <span class="title">Grihasta</span>; another division of them is
formed by the <dfn>Avach’háta</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_426" id="fnanchor_426"></a><a href="#footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></span>
“emaciated by abstinence,”
who are the adepts of this sect; if I were
to relate every thing of them, several volumes would
not be sufficient to contain my account.</p>

<p>In the Nababship of Kalinga exists a sect called
<span class="title">Sûrwar</span> (Sûryar), and another entitled <span class="title">Gundwar</span>.
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
They pay no tribute to any body; they worship the
sun; from simplicity, they prefer brass and copper
to gold, on account of bad smell. When one of
them dies, they seize a stranger and kill him. They
say that, as the Rái (prince) of Gund sits upon the
ground, the lower people sit upon chairs, he being
the lord of the earth and the others are not so.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Chandra bakta</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_427" id="fnanchor_427"></a><a href="#footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></span>
or “worshippers of the
moon,” call this planet one of the principal divinities,
worthy of adoration and of worship; the
regulation of the nether world is committed to his
care; by the increase and decrease of the light of
this heavenly body, the hours of night and day may
be known; after the sun it is the greatest, and borrows
its light from this great luminary, the access
to which may also be obtained by the moon’s mediation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_428" id="fnanchor_428"></a><a href="#footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></span>
These sectaries form an image of the moon,
and worship it as an object of their devotion: they
never hurt a sentient being.</p>

<p>Another sect venerates other stars. There is one
who pays homage to <dfn>Agni</dfn>, or fire, and says that
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
fire is the pure essence of God, who is the sun himself:
these are called <span class="title">Agni Pramána</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_429" id="fnanchor_429"></a><a href="#footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></span>
“the professors
of fire.” They believe also the other stars
proceed from its radiance, and that the earthly fire
is an emanation of its rays; they venerate every sort
of fire, through the mediation of which they think
access to the sun may be obtained.</p>

<p>Another sect, the <dfn>Pavana bhakta</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_430" id="fnanchor_430"></a><a href="#footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></span>
or “worshippers
of the wind,” believe that the substance of
God is air, and this also the intellectual soul.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Jala bhakta</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_431" id="fnanchor_431"></a><a href="#footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></span>
or “worshippers of water,”
hold water to be the representative of the being of
God, on which account they pay veneration to the
rivers and flowing streams.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Prithivi bhakta</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_432" id="fnanchor_432"></a><a href="#footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></span>
are “worshippers of the
earth,” which they believe to be the substance of
God worthy of their adoration.</p>

<p>Another sect, called <span class="title">Tripújas</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_433" id="fnanchor_433"></a><a href="#footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></span>
worship the three
kingdoms of nature, in which every place and whatever
presents itself to their view, becomes an object
of their veneration.</p>

<p><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
The <dfn>Manushya bhakta</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_434" id="fnanchor_434"></a><a href="#footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></span>
or “worshippers of mankind,”
recognise the being of God in man; they
know no being more perfect than mankind, and
think that it contains nothing of a bad nature.</p>

<p>A particular sect is to be found in Kashíal, a place
in the mountainous province of Kachmir. They
worship idols; the son takes the property acquired
by his father to himself; but leaves whatever he
gains to his sons, so that it may be the firewood
belonging to his father that may burn his body.
When one of them dies, a barber from without the
house goes before the dead, and then brings the
message that such a one wants something for a
meal, upon which they go to work to prepare it;
and this society is kept up for some days; then, they
burn the dead; after cremation, they erect over his
ashes an image of stone, one half of which is male,
and the other female; and when no son of his remains,
they marry his wife with a column of the
house, and whoever comes upon a visit of condolence,
has intercourse with the woman until a son be
produced, and to him the inheritance is bestowed.
This sect have no regard for the life of animals.</p>

<p>Another sect exists in the mountains of Kachmir,
with the name of <span class="title">Durds</span>. Among them it is customary
for brothers to have but one wife; occasionally they
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
sell house, land, wife, and children; whoever buys
the house owns all these; they also pawn their wife.
Some of them, even when they become Muselmans,
still adhere to this custom. They also do not spare
animals.</p>

<p>Further to be noticed in Hindostan is the tribe of
<span class="title">Dhaids</span>, one of the lowest classes of men; they eat
every thing but men; they worship the sun. The
author of this book met one day in Sikakul, in the
district of Kalinga, one of these men, whose name
was Nága, and asked him: “Who are the best men
among all the tribes?” The man answered: “The
<span class="title">Dhaids</span>,” and subjoined: “When they leave the
body, they unite with God; when a Brahman dies,
he becomes a cow; when a Muselman expires,
he is transformed into a plant.” I enquired further:
“If the Dhaids be so highly favoured by
God, why should they eat every thing which they
find, the flesh of cows, horses, mice, and the like?”
The man replied: “It is because God loves this tribe
that he gave them this command: ‘Eat whatever
you like.’”</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Choharas</span> are now to be mentioned, known in
Hindostan as cleaners of privies and sweepers of
the ground; and in the exercise of this profession
they visit the houses. They say, their master was
Shah Jhuna; he, in one hand a besom of gold, and
in the other a basket of silver, cleans now in the
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
fourth heaven the house of God, and sweeps the
apartments of the Highest. This tribe too eat every
thing as the Dhaids.</p>

<p>The Nânac-Panthians,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_435" id="fnanchor_435"></a><a href="#footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></span>
who are known as composing
the nation of the Sikhs, have neither idols
nor temples of idols. <span class="title">Nânac</span> belonged to the tribe
of Bédíans, who are Kshatriyas. His reputation
rose in the time of Zehir-ed-din Baber Padshah<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_436" id="fnanchor_436"></a><a href="#footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></span>
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
(who inhabits heaven). Before the victory of this
king over the Afghans, Nânac was a grain-factor<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_437" id="fnanchor_437"></a><a href="#footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></span>
of Daulet khan Lodi,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_438" id="fnanchor_438"></a><a href="#footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></span>
who ranked among the distinguished
Umras of Ibrahim Khan, the sovereign of
Hindostan.</p>

<p>A durvish came to Nânac, and subdued his
mind in such a manner that he, Nânac, having
entered the granary, gave away the property of
Daulet-Khan, and his own, whatever he found
there and in his house, and abandoned his wife and
children. Daulet Khan was struck with astonishment
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
at hearing this, but, recognising in Nânac the
mark of a durvish, he withheld his hand from hurting
him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_439" id="fnanchor_439"></a><a href="#footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></span>
In a short time Nanac made a great progress
in piety; at first he took little nourishment;
afterwards he allowed himself but to taste a little
cow-milk; next a little oil; then nothing but water,
and at last he took nothing but air: such men
the Hindus call <span class="title">pavana haris</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_440" id="fnanchor_440"></a><a href="#footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>Nanac had a great number of disciples. He professed
the unity of God, which is called the law of
Muhammed, and believed the metempsychosis, or
transmigration of the soul from one body to another.
Having prohibited his disciples to drink wine and to
eat pork, he himself abstained from eating flesh, and
ordered not to hurt any living being. After him, this
precept was neglected by his followers; but <span class="person">Arjun
mal</span>, one of the substitutes of his faith, as soon as he
found that it was wrong, renewed the prohibition to
eat flesh, and said: “This has not been approved
by Nânac.” Afterwards, Hargovind, son of Arjunmal,
eat flesh, and went to hunt, and his followers
imitated his example.</p>

<p>Nanac praised the religion of the Muselmans, as
well as the Avatars and the divinities of the Hindus;
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
but he knew that these objects of veneration were
created and not creators, and he denied their real
descent <em>from heaven</em>, and their union <em>with mankind</em>.
It is said that he wore the rosary of the Muselmans
in his hand, and the Zunar, or the religious thread
of the Hindus, around his neck.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_441" id="fnanchor_441"></a><a href="#footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></span>
Some of his distinguished
disciples report of him more than can
here find room.</p>

<p>One of these reports is, that Nanac, being dissatisfied
with the Afghans, called the Moghuls into the
country, so that in the year 932 of the Hejira (A. D.
1525) Zehir ed-din Baber padshah (who is in heaven)
gained the victory over Ibrahim, the king of the
Afghans.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_442" id="fnanchor_442"></a><a href="#footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></span>
They say also that Nanac, during one
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
of his journeys,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_443" id="fnanchor_443"></a><a href="#footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></span>
finding himself one night in a fort,
was absorbed in a vision of God. Children played
around him, and some put their hands upon his
body, without any motion being perceived in him;
they sewed his eye-lids, his nostrils, and his flesh
together, and tied his hands fast. When Nanac
recovered his senses, he found himself in this state,
and went to a neighbouring house, at the threshold
of which he called out: “Ho! is there any body in
the house who may free my eye-lids sewed together
and my hands?” A handsome woman, having
conducted him into the house, untied his hands
and tore the threads by which his eye-lids were
sewed together with her teeth asunder, on which
account the color of the mark of the woman’s caste
remained upon Nanac’s forehead. After his having
left the house, the neighbours saw the mark, and
supposed his having had an intimate connexion with
the woman; wherefore she was abused by the people
and repudiated by her husband.</p>

<p>This woman came one day to Nanac, and said: “I
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
have, upon the way of God, rendered thee a service,
and now they revile me for it.” Nanac
answered: “To-morrow will the gate of the fort
be shut, but shall not be opened unless thou
appliest thy hand to it.” The next day, in spite
of all efforts to open the gate, they could not succeed,
and remained in great consternation. Men
and beasts, far from water, could not go out to fetch
it. The inhabitants addressed themselves to all men
who had a reputation for sanctity, but their prayers
were in vain. At last they had recourse to Nanac,
and said: “O durvish, what is there to be done?”
He answered: “The gate shall not be opened except
by the hand of a woman who never lost her virtue
with a stranger.” The inhabitants brought all
the women who had a reputation for chastity to
the gate of the fort, but it remained shut: on that
account they sat down hopeless. At the time of
evening prayer came at last the friend of Baba Nanac
to the gate. The people laughed at her; her husband
and her relations were ashamed and abused
her. The woman, without listening to the speeches
of the people, struck the gate with her hand and it
opened. All men were astonished and ashamed:
they fell at the feet of the woman.</p>

that is to say the poems, of Nânac, are,
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
as it were, perfumed with devotion and wisdom,
still more can this be said of his speeches about the
grandeur and sanctity of God. All is in the language
of the <span class="title">Jats</span> of the Panjab, and <dfn>Jat</dfn> in the dialect
of the Penjab, means a villager or a rustic.</p>

<p>Nânac’s disciples are not conversant with the
Sanscrit language. The precepts and regulations
which Nânac established among them will be explained
hereafter.</p>

<p>Nânac said in his poems that there are several
heavens and earths; and that prophets, and saints,
and those that are supposed to have descended from
above (avatárs), and persons distinguished by piety,
obtain perfection by zeal in the service of God; that
whoever devotes himself to the veneration of God,
whatever road he may choose, will come to God,
and that the means to this is, to avoid hurting any
living being.</p>

<p>Nánac left children in the Penj-ab,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_446" id="fnanchor_446"></a><a href="#footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></span>
they are called
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
<span class="title">Kartaris</span>; but according to the opinion of some, he
had no offspring. They say that, after Nánac’s decease,
his place was by his order occupied by the
Guru <span class="place">Angad</span>, of the Srín tribe of Kshatriyas; next
succeeded the Guru <span class="person">Amaradas</span>, of the tribe of the
Bholáyí-Kshatriyas; after him came the Guru <span class="person">Ráma-das</span>,
who was of the Sódahí-Kshatriyas, and also
called the Srí-guru. Ráma-das, dying, left his dignity
to his son <span class="person">Arjunmal</span>. During the life of this Guru,
the Sikhs, that is to say, his followers grew great in
number and in faith. They said, Bábá Nânac is a
god, and the world his creation; but Nánac in his
poems reckons himself a servant of God, and he calls
God <span class="title">Naránjen</span> (Naráyana), <span class="title">Parabrahma</span>, and <span class="title">Permaisher</span>
(Paramésvara), who is without a body, and has
nothing corporeal, nor deigns to be united with a
bodily frame. The Sikhs say that Nánac, in the
same manner, had been without a real body, but
visible by the power of his individuality,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_447" id="fnanchor_447"></a><a href="#footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></span>
and they
believe that, when Nânac expired,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_448" id="fnanchor_448"></a><a href="#footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></span>
his spirit became
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
incarnate in the person of <span class="person">Angad</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_449" id="fnanchor_449"></a><a href="#footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></span>
who attended him
as his confidential servant. Angad, at his death,
transmitted his soul into the body of <span class="person">Amara das</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_450" id="fnanchor_450"></a><a href="#footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></span>
and thus Guru, in the same manner, conveyed his
spirit into the body of <span class="person">Ráma-das</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_451" id="fnanchor_451"></a><a href="#footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></span>
whose soul transmigrated
into the person of <span class="person">Arjunmal</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_452" id="fnanchor_452"></a><a href="#footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></span>
in short,
they believe that, with a mere change of name, Nânac
the First became Nânac the Second, and so on,
to the Fifth, in the person of Arjunmal. They say,
that whoever does not recognise in Arjunmal the
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
true Bábá Nânac, is an unbeliever; they have a
number of tales about the founder of their sect, and
assert that Bábá Nânac, in a former world, was the
radja Janak.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_453" id="fnanchor_453"></a><a href="#footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>When Sakha-daiv (Saha déva),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_454" id="fnanchor_454"></a><a href="#footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></span>
the son of Baiás
(Vyasa), a rakhaisher (rakshasa), came to Janak, in
order to learn from him the path of God, he found
the rája, who had thrown one of his feet into the
fire; men on foot and on horseback formed a file;
Nawabs and Vizirs were busy about the affairs of the
state; elephants and horses presented themselves
to the view. Saha dév thought in his mind that
such occupations and worldly concerns were unbecoming
so pious a man. The rája, who was skilled
in penetrating the hearts of others, found it out, and
employing the power of magic, he caused fire to
fall upon the houses, so that at last all the horses and
fine palaces were burnt. The rája seemed neither
to hear, nor to see, nor to care any thing about what
happened, until the fire reached the house where he
and Saha dév were. Janak did not throw one look
upon it. The fire fell upon the wooden cup, which
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
they call there <dfn>kermandel</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_455" id="fnanchor_455"></a><a href="#footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></span>
and which Saha dév
used for drinking water. He now, senseless, jumped
from his place, and took hold of his kermandel.
The rája smiled, and said to him: “All my people,
and all this, my property, were burnt; my heart
was not bound to them; wherefore I let them
be consumed, and feel no pain about them; but
thou, on account of thy kermandel, jumpedst
senseless from thy place. It is now clear whose
heart is bound to the things of this world.”
Saha dèv was ashamed of his having been disturbed.
This tale was heard from the followers of Nânac.</p>

<p>The history of Janak and of Saha dév is contained
in the <cite>Jog bashest</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_456" id="fnanchor_456"></a><a href="#footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></span>
which is one of the principal
books of the Hindus, in the following manner:
Bisvámiter (Viśvamitra)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_457" id="fnanchor_457"></a><a href="#footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></span>
in presence of the Rakshasas
addressed this speech to Ráma chander: “O
Rama chander, venerate thy father and mother;
thou who issuedst from them so beautiful, thou
hast accomplished thy task; by the goodness of
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
thy nature and by the purity of thy character,
thou hast polished the mirror of thy heart, and
given it such a brightness, that the perfection o
God is manifest in it; the success which a zealous
disciple obtains, after many difficulties and pious
exercises under the direction and instruction of a
Rakshasa, during a long period of time, that success
became thy share without trouble; thine
became the science to be acquired; and thine is,
even in this life, the emancipation in the form of
Saha dèv, the son of Vyása. He, thy father,
on account of the excellence of his pure form and
of his divine nature, having come forth wise from
the womb of his mother, without any assistance
manifested his perfection, and on account of the
clearness of his intellect, whatever on the way of
his journey, was accessible to wisdom and excellence,
was open to his looks, and no veil nor curtain
remained before him; nevertheless, even with
such advantages, he was inquisitive with Rakshasas
and wise men in matters of theology, so that
these personages, or pious penitents, gave him
directions and lessons, and offered him their advice
with alacrity. Thus am I ready to give thee some
instruction, and communicate some precepts of
wisdom to thee.” Therefore Rámachander inquired
of Visvámiter: “As Saha dèv brought the
full measure of wisdom from the body of his mother,
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
and as his nature was endowed with such
perfection, my prayer is, that you may favor me
with an explicit account of him, and explain to
me by what means he procured to himself the
advice of the wise, and in what manner the Rakshasas
imparted instruction to him.” Visvámiter
replied: “O Rama chander, thy condition is as
fortunate as that of Saha dèv; such was his
dignity and excellence, that men, by listening to
his tale, feel themselves emancipated, and are no
more subject to be born again. O Ramachander,
he too was impressed with the idea that in no
condition this world is permanent, but that all
that is seen changes every moment, and passes
from one state to another. One guest arrives and
comes into the world, another dies and goes out
of the world; the one is agitated with distress,
the other is quiet; the one exulting, the other
overcome with grief; in short, whoever and whatever
exists in this world is liable to change; there
is not the least hope of firmness and steadiness,
and nothing is worthy to bind our hearts. But
that which is firm and steady, deserves that we
attach our hearts to it, and that we perpetually
are mindful of, and fix our thoughts and meditate
upon it. Nothing however is firm and steady but
the pure being of <dfn>Brahma</dfn>, that is to say, the supreme
and true entity of God. Moreover, whoever
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">259</span>
directs his mind solely towards the divinity,
will attain the knowledge of it, and render himself
perfectly free from the desires of the heart,
and from the pleasures of the body, which tend to
swell and to fetter the soul. And like the bird
<span class="title">Pápîhá</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_458" id="fnanchor_458"></a><a href="#footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></span>
which is fond of the water which falls
from the cloud <span class="title">Náisán</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_459" id="fnanchor_459"></a><a href="#footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></span>
and does not taste of any
other liquid from river or well, but thirsting only
for drops from the cloud Náisan, is taken up with
the search for them; thus Saha dév, having
made himself independent and free from all desires
and allurements, was always immersed in
the contemplation of Brahma, and having dissolved
his own being in the reality of God, he knew
Brahma, and attained the state of absolute repose
and quietness. When he thus became a master
of excellence, and as perfect as other rakshasas,
then he felt the desire of his heart accomplished,
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
and with a mind more splendid than the moon of
a fortnight, he passed through the troubles of
life, according to the words of the prophet:
‘With a heavenly mind upon the carpet of
eternity.’”</p>

<p>One day, during a pleasure excursion in this
world, he happened to reach the mountain Sumair,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_460" id="fnanchor_460"></a><a href="#footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></span>
that is <span class="place">Alburz</span>, which in Arabia, is called <span class="title">Káf</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_461" id="fnanchor_461"></a><a href="#footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></span>
Upon
the top of this mountain, he saw his father Vyása,
who in a cavern was occupied with the contemplation
of Brahma. Having saluted his father according
to the custom of the Hindus, he asked him:
“My worthy father, you who possess the knowledge
of the supreme being, inform me in what manner
this knowledge of the unity of God is diffused in
the multitude, in what way the creatures of this
world obtain their forms, to what period their
existence is extended, what is the cause of their
duration, and how their existence happens to be
renewed several times, in order that I may possess
proper notions of the state of this world, and that
I may unravel this mystery to myself.”</p>

<p>Vyása, according to the desire of his son, explained
the original state of the creation in clear words; but
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
as the mind of the sage was involved in his own
thoughts, and occupied with the contemplation of
Brahma, he gave only a short account of the creation
and of the development of this world to Saha
dév, who did not derive an entire satisfaction from
it. Vyása knew his thoughts, and said: “O son,
my mind being immersed in the study and in the
contemplation of God, I cannot, for want of time,
impart to thee at present distinctly the account
which thou desirest; but I will put thee in the
way by which thou mayst arrive at the satisfaction
of thy heart, and I will send thee to a man
who will gratify thee. Know then, that in the
country of Tirhut<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_462" id="fnanchor_462"></a><a href="#footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></span>
is a town called Míthila, and
there resides Janaka, the Rája, who is an excellent
man, and possesses incomparable knowledge.
Go to him, and engage him to satisfy thy heart.
He will give thee an explicit account of the creation
of the world from beginning to end.” Saha
dév, according to the direction of his father, having
left him, went into Tirhut, to the town of Mithila.
He saw a city populous, and delightfully built; the
soldiers content with the Rája, and the rayots (country
people) happy and satisfied. Nobody complained
at that time of his lot: in the evening every one laid
down in his corner, and at day-break attended the
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
court of Rája Janaka. The guards at the door
observed Saha dév, <dfn>tapasí</dfn>, that is, a pious adorer
of God, the son of Vyása, who stood at the gate and
asked entrance. The rája Janaka, before he received
the report of it, knew from inward knowledge
and from the light of his mind, the purpose of Saha-dév’s
mind; but in order to try his character, and
to put his sincerity and his individuality to the test,
he took no notice of the appearance of the stranger.
Saha-dév, who had come near him, remained there
one day and one night. On the next day, Janaka
set about his business; the great and the vulgar
appeared before him. This day too, and the following
eight days and eight nights the rája did not
address any question to Saha dév, who remained
in his place without saying a word to any body.
The eighth day, the rája Janak, when he saw that
Saha-dév stood the test by shewing the mark of
excellence and betraying no unsteadiness, he ordered
that the stranger should be introduced into the interior
of the palace and into the private apartments.
Beforehand, he enjoined the maids of the bed-chamber
and all the people of the palace that, on Saha-dév’s
arrival, they should place before him all sorts
of exquisite viands and agreeable perfumes, and whatever
might allure the mind, and that they should
endeavour to fascinate and to madden him. When
Saha dév, by order of the rája Janaka, had entered
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
the private apartments, handsome women brought
before him from all sides delicious meats, and garments,
and every thing that was attracting, and
showed him great respect; after humble prostrations,
they placed him in an elegant apartment.
During other seven days and nights the rája did not
appear before him. The people of the inner apartments,
according to the rája’s orders, did what they
could in a thousand different ways to please him:
they approached him, clasped their hands with his,
rubbed his hands and feet; they served and tempted
him by four principal means, namely: first, by the
splendour of handsome maids; secondly, by offering
him whatever may charm the senses; thirdly, by
tokens of respect, and fourthly, by rubbing his
hands and feet. Their intent was, if there remained
any human feeling in him, to rouse it up. Saha dév,
like a mountain that is not moved by any wind,
stood firm; he took notice of nothing, and threw
not even a look upon the beautiful moon-faced damsels
about him. The rája Janaka, when informed
that not the least trace of human feeling, lust, or
desire had remained in the young man, and that he
had freed himself from the fetters of error and sensuality,
ran without hesitation from the place where
he was, and touched the feet of Saha dév, saying:
“Be thou happy, O rakshasa! who art united with
the supreme spirit, and in whom has remained
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
no trace of the qualities of water, earth, and of
human nature, thou, who hast acquired whatever
may be desirable to thy regeneration: for
thou possessest the knowledge of God. Now,
tell me, with what intention didst thou come to
me, and what dost thou expect from our meeting?”
Saha dév replied to the rája: “My intention in
coming here was to obtain from thee a true account
of the creation; in what manner this world
came forth from the unity of the divine being,
and how from him, the One, proceeded the duality
and multiplicity of forms. Explain this to me,
and impress it distinctly upon my mind. Although
I received from my father some true notion of the
creation of this world, and although, from the
interior light and from the purity of heart which
I have acquired by my devotion, the truth of the
great question presents itself to my mind, yet I
desire instruction from thee, and hope to receive
it from thy tongue.” The rája Janak revealed to
Saha dév, according to his wish, the history of the
creation of the world. After that Saha dév said
again to the rája: “O king! it is certain that between
steady, wise, and learned men there is no contradiction;
so does the account of the origin of the
world, which I have heard from my father Vyása,
and which I have well impressed upon my mind,
agree with that which thy tongue has communicated
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
to me. The substance of it is, that the creation
of the world and the existence of its inhabitants
took place by the will and by the disposition
of Brahma, and according to the purpose of the
supreme being, and that, when it is the desire of
Brahma, the world is created, and when the
supreme being finds it right to withdraw hímself
from the circle of beings, the world returns to
nothing, and its inhabitants are again enveloped
with the veil of nothingness and voidness, and
nothing remains but God. In like manner is the
existence of all bodies connected with the will of
the divine spirit, so that every being in dependence
upon this will, and in conformity with the principles
of its own nature, each time comes into,
and goes out of, the world, or is born and dies.
It is when the worldly desires, connections, and
concerns are annihilated, that a man no more
returns to nor leaves this world; birth and death
upon this earth no more concern him, because the
ties formed by his desires are broken.” Saha dév
continued: “O rája, what thou hast said, is impressed
upon my mind; but tell me, if there
remains any thing, however minute it may be, of
the account of this world; this too I wish to
hear.” The rája Janaka said: “The account of
the world is such as thou hast heard. That holy
being, without a name, without a mark, without
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
an equal, is pure and free from lust and desire,
and his providence brings forth this world. He,
the one perfect being, in what a multitude of
beings does he not manifest himself! And if he
removes from this creation the support of his will
and of his providence, nothing remains but himself,
the only being. O Saha dév, thou who hast
purified thy heart from the attachments of this
body, and liberated it from all desires and seductive
propensities, thou hast convinced thyself of
the trut that, whatever appears before our eyes,
is nothing, and has neither reality nor substance;
what was to be performed, thou hast accomplished
it; what was to be known, thou hast acquired it,
and thou hast proved thyself true; on that account
thou art, even in thy life-time, possessed of
<dfn>mukt</dfn> (emancipation); that is to say: as a person,
when the soul has left his body, is freed from the
want of aliment, so hast thou, although still in
the state of life and health, been liberated from all
bodily wants.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_463" id="fnanchor_463"></a><a href="#footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></span>
Happy be thy life! blessed be thy
age, O Saha dév!”</p>

<p>Viśvamitra continued: “O Ramachander, thou
hast acquired the same knowledge as Saha dév;
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
in the same manner as he abandoned all desires,
subdued all the appetites of his five senses, and
possessed perfect freedom, in the same manner
thou must not permit any sort of desire to enter
in thy heart.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_464" id="fnanchor_464"></a><a href="#footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></span>
There is no other means of <span class="title">mukt</span>
but this: to this thou must tend.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_465" id="fnanchor_465"></a><a href="#footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>After that he addressed the rakshasas and all those
who were present, in the following speech: “O
rakshasas! and you who seek the road of God,
know that, as Ramachander, by the purity of his
nature and by the goodness of his disposition,
raised himself to the highest dignity, not less
ought to be the excellence of all the wise who are
destined to the acquisition of <span class="title">mukt</span>; thirsting for
the knowledge of the highest, they ought to listen
to the speeches of all those who devote themselves
to God; nay, the truth and the faith, which Ramachander
possessed, ought to be common, and
productive of the same consolation and tranquillity
to all those who, not in vain, aspire to wisdom
and sanctity. I have imparted to Ramachander
what I knew to be the best; now is the
time of <span class="person">Bashest</span> (Vas&nbsp;ishta), who attained such a
perfection of a rakshasa, that nothing that is, was,
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
and will be, is concealed to him, and he has no
equal in the world.” So far goes the text of <cite>Jog
bahest</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_466" id="fnanchor_466"></a><a href="#footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>The Guru Nánac, according to the belief of his
followers, was in former times the rája called Janak,
and united the dignity of a king with that of a saint.
He called mankind to God. The author of this work
heard from distinguished Sikhs that, when Bába
Nánac appeared in the Sat-jog, a great number of
Sikhs assembled around him. He sent a cow into
the kitchen. When prepared, it was brought into
the assembly; some ate of it, others were afraid to
do so. The Guru prayed to God that the cow might
rise again, and all those who had been afraid, beholding
this miracle, approached him praying:
“Now we shall eat whatever you order.” Nánac
answered: “Not now be it so: mine and your
engagement prevails in the Trèta-Jog.” Afterwards,
at the revolution of the Trèta-jog, the Guru
appeared. The disciples assembled; then a slaughtered
horse was brought into the assembly in the
manner before said. Some ate of it; others abstained
from it. The Guru prayed, and the horse was brought
to life. Those who had been afraid prayed as before.
He replied again: “Your word and mine are engaged
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
for the Dwápar-jog.” In this age they brought
a slaughtered elephant into the assembly of his followers.
The same happened as I said before, and
he appointed them for the Kali-jog. In this age,
they say, a man was brought into the assembly;
whoever ate, became free; who abstained from it,
remained subject to durance, and some of the Sikhs
call Nánac the slave of God.</p>

<p>It is also related that, when Nânac died, in the
Sat-jog, two roads opened before his soul: the one
led to heaven, the other to hell. Nânac chose the
latter, and having descended below, he brought all
the inhabitants out of hell. The Lord God said to
him: “These sinners cannot enter heaven; you
must return into the world and liberate them.”
On that account Nânac came to this world, and his
followers are the former inhabitants of hell; the
Guru comes and goes, until that multitude shall have
found their salvation.</p>

<p>Except the zealots among the Sikhs, no man else
believes Bábá Nânac a god. As to the rest, Nânac’s
followers condemn idolatry, and believe that all their
Gurus are Nânacs, as was said before. They do not
recite the mantras of the Hindus, they do not venerate
their temples, nor do they esteem their Avatárs.
The Sanscrit language, which according to the Hindus
is the language of the gods, is not held in such
great estimation by the Sikhs. Whatever it be,
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
the number of these sectaries increased every where,
so that, in the time of the Guru Arjunmal it became
very considerable, and at last there was no place in
any country where Sikhs were not to be found.
They make no difference between Brahmans and
Kshatriyas, for Nânac was a Kshatriya, and none
of their Gurus was a Brahman, as stated above.
Thus they subjected the Kshatriyas to the tribe of
Jats,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_467" id="fnanchor_467"></a><a href="#footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></span>
who are an inferior caste of Baisas (Viśas).
The deputies of the Gurus are besides frequently
Jats. They honour equally Brahmans and Kshatriyas.
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
The Guru is chosen at the discretion of his
followers. It should be known that, in the time of
the Afghan sultans, the Umras were called successors
or deputies of Ali; finally, for the sake of brevity,
the name of deputy (masnad) alone was used
by the Hindus. The Sikhs call <span class="title">masnad</span>, and also
<span class="title">Rámadas</span>, the Guru whom they esteem as a king of
the true faith.</p>

<p>Before the fifth period no tribute was exacted from
the Sikhs, but presents were given by them according
to their own discretion, to their Gurus. Arjunmal
sent in his time a person to the Sikhs of each
town in order to collect a tribute; in that manner,
the Sikhs accustomed themselves to the government
of a masnad, or deputy. Their principal deputies,
of whom there was a great number, elected on their
part deputies, so that such substitutes were to be
found in every place. The Sikhs created their
Gurus, and established that an <dfn>audasi</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_468" id="fnanchor_468"></a><a href="#footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></span>
or one that
has abandoned the world, is not to be esteemed
higher than any other man. On that account, some
of their Gurus are inclined to agriculture, others to
commerce, and to various trades and occupations.
Each of them brings every year something, according
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
to his means, to his Guru; the deputy receives a present
without exacting it; others collect what is destined
every year to the deputy, and deliver it to the
chief man of the Guru, who disposes of it for his
own maintenance and for other contingencies; no
body incurs blame on account of presents (or contributions):
being raised from all quarters, they are
forwarded to the Guru.</p>

<p>In the month of February, when the sun is in the
sign of the Bull, the subordinate Gurus come to
their chief with those of their followers who choose
to accompany them. At the time of taking leave,
each receives a turban as a present from the deputy.</p>

<p>Having recorded truly something of the Sikhs in
general, I will now give an account of the chiefs of
this tribe whom I have known myself. In the sixth
period lived Sri Guru Har-govind, the son of the
Guru Arjun mal. The Padshah Nur-ed-din Jehangir,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_469" id="fnanchor_469"></a><a href="#footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></span>
now an inhabitant of heaven, called to his
court Arjun-mal, on account of his having offered
prayers for the king’s son Khusro, who had rebelled
against his father. Khusro having been taken, the
king ordered the imprisonment of Arjun-mal, and
wanted to extort a large sum of money from him.
The Guru was helpless; they kept him a prisoner
in the sandy country of Lahore, until he died of the
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pageno">273</span>
heat of the sun and of ill treatment. This happened
in the year 1015 of the Hejira (A. D. 1606).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_470" id="fnanchor_470"></a><a href="#footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></span>
In like
manner the king banished from Hindostan the Shaikh
Nezam Thánasír, because he had been connected
with, and had prayed for, his son Khusro.</p>

<p>After Arjunmal followed his brother Baratha,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_471" id="fnanchor_471"></a><a href="#footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></span>
whom his followers called “the benevolent Guru.”
Now, in the year 1055 of the Hejira (A. D. 1645),
the Guru <span class="person">Harjayi</span> occupies his place. They both
professed the adoration of one God. The disciples
of the Guru Har-govind, son of Arjunmal, called
these Gurus Mainá (مينا)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_472" id="fnanchor_472"></a><a href="#footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></span>
which among them is an <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">مينا</span>
oprobrious name. After the decease of Arjunmal,
his son, Har-govind, also made pretensions to the
khalifat (deputyship), and obtained the place of his
father.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_473" id="fnanchor_473"></a><a href="#footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></span>
Hargovind was always attached to the
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">274</span>
stirrup of the victorious Jehangir. He became
involved in many difficulties; one of them was,
that he appropriated to himself the pay due to the
soldiers in advance; he carried also the sword against
his father; he kept besides many servants, and was
addicted to hunting. Jehangir, on account of the
money due to the army, and of the mulet imposed
upon Arjunmal (as was said before), sent Har-govind
to the fort of Gwalior,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_474" id="fnanchor_474"></a><a href="#footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></span>
where he remained
imprisoned twelve years. He was not permitted to
eat a good meal. During that time the deputies and
other Sikhs used to come and bow before the walls
of the fort. At last, moved by pity, the king granted
him liberty. After Jehangir’s death, Har-govind
entered the service of his majesty Amír-ul Múnenîn
Abu-ul-muzafer shaháb ed-din Muhammed saheb
Keran sani shah Jehan, the victorious king. When
the Guru returned to Batnesh, which is a district of
the Penjab, he attached himself to Yar Khan, the
eunuch, who held the office of a Foujdar<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_475" id="fnanchor_475"></a><a href="#footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></span>
in the
Nawabí of the Penjab, and whom he assisted in the
administration. Har-govind returned to Rámadaspúr,
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">275</span>
where the Gurus Rámadas and Arjun-mal had
built great edifices and dug tanks. There he sustained
an attack of the army which Shah jehan, the
shadow of God, sent against him, and the Guru’s
property was then plundered. From thence he fled
to Kartarpúr; there too war reached him, and on
this occasion Mír Badherah, and Páindah Khan, the
son of Fattah Khan Ganáida, found their death.
Before and after this, he encountered great dangers
of war, but with the aid of God he escaped unhurt,
although he lost his property. It is related by one,
Sadah by name, that in this war a man aimed a blow
at the Guru, who parried it, and struck him with his
blade, saying: “Not in that manner, but so the
sword is used;” and with one blow he made an
end of his foe. One of the companions of the Guru
asked the author of this work: “What was the
purport of the words by which the Guru accompanied
his blow?” I said: “It was to give
instruction, as it belongs to a Guru to teach also
how to strike a blow with a sword; for a Guru is
called a teacher: he did not strike out of anger,
which would have been blameable.” At last he
retired from the war of Kartarpúr to Bhagwárah,
and because there, in the vicinity of Lahore, he met
with difficulties, he betook himself from thence in
haste to Gerait púr, which lies in the mountainous
district of the Penjab, and was then dependent upon
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">276</span>
the rája Tárachand, who had never paid homage to
the pádsháh Shah Jehan. The inhabitants of this
country adore idols. Upon the summit of a fortified
mountain, they raised an image of the Déva, named
<span class="title">Nâina</span> (Naráyana). Rájas and other eminent persons
made pilgrimages to this place. At the time
when the Guru came there, one of the Sikhs, called
Bhairo, who accompanied him, entered the temple
and struck off the nose of the idol. The rájas, having
been informed of it, came to the Guru to complain
of the act, and named the man who did it. The
Guru called Bhairo before him. The Sikh denied
the deed. The servants of the rájas declared: “We
know the man.” He replied: “O rájas, ask you
the god: if he tells you my name, kill me.” The
rájas said: “You blockhead! how shall the god
speak?” Bhairo laughed and answered: “Now
it is clear who is the blockhead: if the god cannot
defend his head, nor point out the man who struck
him, what benefit do you expect from him, and
why do you venerate his strength?” The rájas
remained silent and confounded. From this time,
the disciples of the Guru increased considerably, and
in this mountainous country, as far as the frontiers
of Thibet and Khota, the name of Muselman was
not heard.</p>

<p>The author of this work heard what follows from
the tongue of Guru Har-govind: “A mighty rája
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
exists in the north or this mountainous country.
One day he sent me an ambassador who asked
information, saying: ‘I have heard that there
is a town named Delhi; what is the name of its
rája, and whose son is he?’ I was astonished to
hear that he did not know even the name of Amír
ul Múmenín saheb Karan sáni (Jehangír).” The
Guru had eight hundred horses in his stable, three
hundred troopers on horseback, and sixty men with
fire-arms were always in his service. Among these
some carried on commerce, and other trades and
occupations. Whoever was a fugitive from his home
took refuge with him.</p>

<p>The Guru believed but one God. A person desired
from him some account of the creation and the constitution
of this world. The Guru said: “The
universe is an appearance without reality, and an
unsubstantial manifestation of God, the highest
being; and all bodies, as well as gods, are an
idle illusion. I will tell thee, said he, a story
of old times: There was a king who went to hunt
the <dfn>hátah jori</dfn>, which in the Turkish language
is called <span class="trans">kamer ghah</span>, and in Persian <span class="trans">barah shikar</span>,
‘a fawn of the chace.’ A deer came into the
circle of the hunting party. The king said: ‘On
whose side the deer will come forth, let him not
return before me until he has taken it with his
hand.’ By fate, the animal came out on the side
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">278</span>
of the king. Khusro run after it until he was far
from the army, and reached a place where, on
account of thick wood, he could not find a path.
The king was glad to think the deer would now
return towards him; but when he came near it,
there was a small opening through which the
game escaped. The king sharply pushed on his
horse, which, contracting itself, passed through
the thicket; but the pádsháh was taken by two
branches, and his arms and feet fastened so as
if it had been purposely brought about. He
remained two days in such a state, until two
persons, a man and a woman, who were gathering
wood, arrived near him. The woman said
to her husband: ‘Look! the king has hanged
a thief.’ The man replied: ‘This is not a place
for hanging; we must examine it nearer.’
When they had approached, they saw and recognised
the king, and said to each other: ‘If we
release him, it will be of use to us.’ The woman
observed: ‘He is the king; once made free, what
advantage will he grant us for it? If he promises
to marry our daughter, we will release
him.’ They said so to the king, who promied
what they desired. After that, they liberated
him, brought him to their house, and gave him
their daughter. He remained there some time,
and then joined his army. When he wanted to
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
enter his palace, the door-keeper struck him with
his stick; the king was seized with a trembling
and awoke. He saw the high throne and the
servants before him waiting for his orders. By
this dream he was aroused from the emptiness of
his illusion; he knew that the world is but an
appearance without reality; and that, whatever
we experience, being awake, is likewise nothing
more than a dream. He found that the diversity
of forms and of distinct bodies is but an image of
existence, and that in truth there is but one real
being, one praiseworthy, and raised above all
others by superlative excellence.”</p>

<p>One of the Brahmans was called Déva, and
counted himself among the wise. He visited the
Guru, and seated himself one day upon the bed of
Bába Jév, who was the son of a Guru. The people
said: “Do not sit there.” He asked: “Why not?”
They answered: “This is the place of the Guru.”
He said: “Is perhaps the figure of a Guru not that
of a man, or have I not a rational soul manifest in
me? or can I not enjoy what another eats or
drinks?” This speech came to the ears of the
Guru Hargovind. He called that man before him,
and said: “O Déva! it is not the whole world but
one being?” He replied: “It is.” The Guru
pointed to an ass, and asked: “Do you know what
this is?” Déva replied: “You are one with God,
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
therefore you are also this.” The Guru laughed,
and was not at all angry. Déva wished to marry
his own sister; the people said: “This is forbidden.”
He answered: “If it were forbidden, the
junction of the sexual parts would be impossible.
Thus, because it is not God’s will that we should
rise up in the air, he withheld from us the faculty
of flying.”</p>

<p>The Sikhs venerated the Guru Har-govind as a
god, and believed that he has passed through six
incarnations. Perah Kaivan, a Yazdanian, was
moved by the reputatation of the Guru, and came
to visit him.</p>

<p>The Guru recognised him, and showed him great
respect. Upon that account Perah Kaivan left him.
A week had scarcely passed after he was gone, when
Har-govind died, on a Sunday, the third day of the
Moherram, in the year 1055 of the Hejirah (A. D.
1645). When they had placed his corpse upon the
pyre, and when the fire rose up in high flames, a
ràjapút called Rájarama, who had been his servant,
precipitated himself into the fire, and walked several
paces in the midst of the flames, until he reached the
feet of the corpse, and having laid his face upon the
soles of the Guru’s feet, he did not move until he
expired. After him, the son of a Jat, who was in
the service of Har-govind’s son-in-law, leaped into
the fire. Many other Sikhs wished to follow his
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
example, but the Guru Har rayi forbade it. Dáulet
Khan Kaksal says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i2a">“Of a hundred sayings of my master, I remember one:</div>
 <div class="i0">The world never becomes a desert, nor the wine-house a prayer-house.</div>
 <div class="i2">What can my soul give more than my heart can bear?</div>
 <div class="i0">Whatever the soul gives, and whatever the heart bears, the one and the other is god-given.”</div>
</div>

<p>The Guru Har-govind, in a letter to the author
of this work, gave himself the title of Nânac, which
was his right distinction. I saw him in the year
1053 of the Hejirah (A. D. 1643) in Kirtpúr. The
Guru Har-ráyi was the grandson of the said Guru;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_476" id="fnanchor_476"></a><a href="#footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></span>
his father was Garuta (or Guru daitya), who is
known under the name of Bábá Jév. The Guru
Har-govind wished first to transmit his place to his
son Garuta, or Bábá Jév; but the Guru Nághura,
one of the Sikhs, brought his daughter to Bábá Jév.
The Bábá wished to send her to his private apartments.
His wife, the mother of Har-ráyi, complained
of it to Har-govind, her father-in-law, who, having
heard her, said to Bábá Jév: “Having given to
Nághura the name of my son, I own him as such,
and his daughter cannot go to you, my son.”
Nághura refused to take back his daughter; nor
would Bábá Jév give her up. The Guru Har-govind
then said: “May neither happiness nor success ever
attend this husband and his wife!” Upon that,
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
the same day, Bábá Jév threw away his nuptial
dress, and sent the daughter of the Guru Nághura
untouched back to her house. In consequence of
this event, Har-govind showed a more particular
esteem for his grandson Har-ráyi,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_477" id="fnanchor_477"></a><a href="#footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></span>
the son of Bábá
Jév; he gave him the name of his father, Bábá Jév,
and appointed him his successor. Invested with
this dignity, Har-rayi remained one year in Kirtpúr.
When in the year of the Hejirah 1055 (A. D. 1645)
Najábet Khan, the son of Sharogh Mirza, by order
of the pádsháh Shah-jehan, invaded with an army
the land of the rája Tarachand, and made the rája
a prisoner, the Guru Har-ráyi betook himself to
Thapal, which town is situated in the district of the
rája Keramperkás, not far from Sirhind.</p>

<p>The Sikhs call Har-ráyi the seventh Guru. He
was a great friend of the author of this work. I
will therefore give an account of some among the
principal chiefs whom I knew, as well as of some
customs of this people. The Sikhs distinguish also
the deputies of their Gurus by the name of Rámdais,
that is to say, “servants of God, or of an idol.”
<span class="person">Jahandas</span> was one of the pretenders to the dignity
of a Guru; he was a man high and proud in his
speeches, not agreeable to any, indifferent to good
and bad that might happen to him. One day he
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
got a wound on his foot. Har-govind told him:
“Do not envelop <em>too much</em>, and raise your foot.”
According to this injunction, he suspended and
uncovered his foot during three months. When the
Guru was informed of it, he said to him: “Cover
your foot; what I told you was intended for the
healing of your wound: do not rest on your foot
for some days.” One day the Guru said to him:
“Tell the Sikhs to bring wood into the kitchen, that
they may gain some remuneration.” Jahandas did
not appear the next day, as if he had not during one
day and a half awoke from sleep. The people, suspecting
some derangement of his brain, thought he
had absented himself. When they, with the Guru,
looked after him, they found him with a bundle of
wood on his shoulder. The Guru said: “I have
not ordered you to bear that.” He replied:
“You gave your orders to the Sikhs; a Sikh am I,
and know not to be any thing higher than they
are.” Another day the Guru went into a garden,
and said to Jahandas: “Remain at the door.” By
accident, the Guru returned home by another door;
Jahandas remained three days on his feet, until Hargovind,
who was informed of it, called him away.</p>

<p>Har-govind had a disciple called <span class="title">Badhata</span>, who
sent a person to bring corn from a field where it was
lying cut. This man gave every thing away, and
then said to Badhata who had sent him: “You
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
distributed every thing, as a father, to the poor;
I did the same in imitation of your example, and
dispense you from the remuneration which I
should have gained by bringing the corn to you.”
Badhata was at first a thief, and his disciples exercised
later the profession of thieving; they showed
themselves very obedient to the orders of their master,
and believed that stealing for him deserved
praise and recompense. Har-govind, according to
the Sikhs, declared that on the day of the last judgment,
his disciples will not have to account for their
actions.</p>

<p><span class="person">Sadah</span>, a disciple of the Guru, went by his orders
to bring horses from Balkh to Irak. He had a son
who had fallen sick. They said to him: “You are
now in the town of Balkh, and but one day’s journey
from home: go to see your son.” He answered:
“If he should die, there is wood enough
in the house to burn him: I went about the
Guru’s business, and will not return.” The
son died, but he did not return. At last he bought
three capital horses of Irak; but Khalíl Bég, a
tyrant, took hold of them, which fell hard upon
him. In the same year, he lost his only son and
heir, and saw himself deprived of strength and
honor. Sadah was a man neither gladdened by
good nor afflicted by bad fortune. The author of
this work was once his companion on a journey from
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
Kabul to the Penjab. The belt of my coat broke;
Sadah gave me immediately his zunnar to serve me
as a belt. I said to him: “Why do you this?” He
answered: “To tie the zunnar purports an engagement
to serve another; as often as I render some
service to friends, may I resign my zunnar for it.”</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i2a">“This thread serves to tie every thing:</div>
 <div class="i0">In a cloister it is a rosary; in a temple of idols a zunnar.”</div>
</div>

<p>A Sikh asked the Guru Har-govind: “In the
absence of my Guru, what other shall I find?” He
replied: “Whichever of the Sikhs comes to your
house under the name of a Guru, him you may
take for yours.” It is the custom among the
Sikhs that, whatever demand they have, they can
state it in the assembly of the Sikhs to the Guru, to
whom they offer whatever present they have, or a
coin, and in so doing they join their hands together,
and proffer prayers to him, that he may be favorable
to them. The Guru states then his demand in
the <dfn>Sangat</dfn> (<dfn>Sangátí</dfn>),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_478" id="fnanchor_478"></a><a href="#footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></span>
that is to say, in the assembly
of the Sikhs. This custom exists also among the
<span class="title">Sipásian</span>, or <span class="title">Izedanian</span>. The belief of this people is,
that an assembly is certainly capable of achieving
every thing, inasmuch as the minds act with their
united strength.</p>

<p>Among the Sikhs there is nothing of the religious
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
rites of the Hindús; they know of no check in eating
or drinking. When <span class="person">Pertábmal</span>, a <dfn>Jnání</dfn>, “wise,”
Hindu, saw that his son wished to adopt the faith
of the Muselmans, he asked him: “Why dost thou
wish to become a Muselman? If thou likest to
eat every thing, become a Guru of the Sikhs, and
eat whatever thou desirest.”</p>

<p>The Sikhs believe that all the disciples of a Guru
go to heaven. Whoever takes the name of Guru is
received in the house of a Sikh. It is related, that
a thief introduced himself once under the title of
Guru, in the house of a Sikh, and was treated as
such. In the morning the Sikh went out to prepare
something better for his guest. The thief saw many
jewels worn by the wife of the Sikh, and having
killed her immediately, and taken the precious
things, he fled. Upon his way he met with the
master of the house, who by force brought him
back. The Sikh, when they returned to the house,
found his wife dead. The thief, seeing every thing
discovered, confessed the truth. The Sikh replied:
“You have done well.” He then shut the door of
the house, and said to his neighbours: “My wife
is sick: she ate nothing of the meal which she had
prepared.” Urging the thief to be gone, he did
not take the jewels from him, but made him a present
of them. He finally burnt his wife.</p>

<p>They also relate what follows: a kalender was in
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
the house of a Sikh. One day the kalender said to
the wife of the Sikh: “For the sake of a Guru,
satisfy my desire.” The woman replied: “I am
the property of another; have patience.” The
kalender, out of fear, did not return to the house of
the Sikh, who asked: “Why does the durvish not
visit me any more?” The woman told him what
had happened. The Sikh said: “Why did you
refuse to yield to his desire?” The woman went
out, and having brought the kalender back, permitted
every thing to him. When, in the month of
February, the Sikhs assembled at the house of the
Guru (who lived before the time of Har-govind), he
threw an angry look at the kalender, and said:
“Him have I struck.” The kalender was stigmatised.</p>

<p>The following anecdote is moreover reported. A
Guru saw a speaking parrot, and praised him much.
A Sikh heard this, and went immediately to the
proprietor of the parrot, who was a soldier, and
asked him for the bird. The soldier said: “If you
give me your daughter, you may have the parrot.”
The Sikh consented. The soldier laughed, and
added: “Give me your wife too, and take the bird.”
The Sikh did not refuse; he conducted the soldier
to his house, and delivered his wife and daughter to
him. When the soldier came home, and told his
wife what had happened, she was so angry with
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
him that he left the parrot in the hands of the Sikh,
to whom he returned his wife and daughter. The
Sikh, joyful, lost no time to gratify the Guru. Such
customs prevailed among the Sikhs before the time
of Har-govind.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_479" id="fnanchor_479"></a><a href="#footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></span></p>

 Badih-eddin, “the marvel of religion,” was the son of Saíd Alí,
and his origin is traced up to the Imám Hossaín, son of Alí. He was
born in the year of the Hejíra 442, A. D. 1050-1. Under the reign of
Ibrahim Sherkey, he came to India, where he died in 1433 A. D., according
to the dates of his birth and death 383 years old, but 395 and even 400
years old, according to the legend of this saint, who owed his longevity
to the power of keeping his breath. Under the simple name of Madár,
he is held in great veneration in India, where an annual feast is celebrated
in his honor, and his tomb visited by numerous pilgrims, even in
our days. He is said to have had 1442 sons, say spiritual children or
disciples&mdash;(See for Madar, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire sur les particularités de la Religion

 The founder of this sect was Patanjali, born in Havriti-varcha, he
taught in Bhagabhandara. His school is theistical, called <span class="title">sa Jswara
Sankhya</span>, or “philosophy with the Lord.” God is the supreme ruler, a
spirit or a soul, distinct from other spirits or souls, untouched by those
evils to which these are subject; indifferent to all good or bad actions
and their consequences, as well as to all transitory conceptions; he is
omniscient; teacher of the earliest things which had a beginning that is,
of all mythological divinities; himself infinite, and illimited by time.
Patanjali insists upon austere religious practices, exterior and interior,
to which he ascribes wonderful effects.</p>

 This passage seems to allude to the Hindu creed about the souls’
journey from the earth to the uppermost heaven. According to this, a
hundred and one arteries issue from the heart, one of which passes to the
crown of the head. By that passage, the soul of the wise issues and meets
a solar ray, by which it proceeds to the realm of fire, and by several other
stages to the <em>moon</em>; thence to the region of lightning, and higher up,
through Varuna’s watery region, to the realm of Indra, so as to reach
at last the abode of Brahma.&mdash;(<abbr title="Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, volume Two pages">Transact. R. A. Soc., vol. II. pp.</abbr> 31. 32.)</p>

Dr. Leyden enriched this stock of materials by supplying the general with

 Zehir-ed-din Muhammed Baber, the son of Umer Shaigh Mirza,
descended on the father’s side from the great Tâimur Beg, and on the
mother’s, from Gengis Khan. He was born A. D. 1483, and succeeded,
in the 12th year of his age to his father, as king of Ferghana, a small
country between Samarkand and Kashgar. Driven by his enemies from
his paternal kingdom, he became the founder of one of the greatest
empires in the world.&mdash;(See <cite>Memoirs of Zehir-ed-din Muhammed Baber,

 Dâulet Khan Lodi, an Afghan by birth, was formerly private secretary
to Mah-Toghluck, the eighth king of Delhi of the Tartarian dynasty, called
Toghluck, which reigned from 1321 to 1412 A. D. At that time Dâulet
Khan was placed at the head of the empire, but, at the end of one year
and three months, he was obliged to yield his power to Khizer Khan, who
founded the dynasty of Sadat, in Delhi. This dynasty, after thirty-eight
years, made room for that of the Afghan princes of Lodi. Dâulat Khan
established himself in the Penjab. In the general disorders of the empire,
this Afghan chief, being attacked by other Afghans, connected himself
with Baber, the Tartarian invader of Hindostan, in 1534, against Ibrahim
Lodi, the Afghan king of Delhi, and after the victory of Baber, continued
to rule the Penjab.</p>

 The first expedition which Baber undertook towards India was, according
to Ferichta, in 1505; from Cabul, which he had conquered the year
before, he pushed to, and along, the Indus. He attempted, later, three
times to invade India, namely, in the years 1519, 1521, and 1522; but,
being engaged in war, on one side with the Usbeck Tartars, and on the
other with the Afghans, he did not completely succeed, till his fourth
attempt in 1525, and in 1526 having overthrown Ibrahim Lody, in a great
battle near Panniput, he destroyed the Afghan dynasty, three kings of
which had reigned 74 years in Delhi. It was probably about this time that
Nânac happened to be introduced to Baber, before whom he maintained his
doctrine with great firmness and eloquence. The Tartarian conqueror,
pleased with the Sikh reformer, ordered an ample maintenance to be
bestowed on him, who refused it, saying, that he trusted in him who
provided for all men&mdash;(<abbr title="General Malcolm">G. M.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 206).</p>

 Nânac (<abbr title="General Malcolm">G. M.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 204) travelled throughout India, and went also to
Mecca and Medina, teaching his doctrine every where with a due regard
to that of others. He showed great moderation, and even courtesy, in
his intercourse with the public teachers of other religions. When he
visited in Multan the Muhammedan Pîrans, or “old wise men,” he said:
“I come, like the sacred Ganga to visit the ocean.”</p>

 “A hundred thousand Muhammeds,” said Nánac (<abbr title="General Malcolm">G. M.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 275) “a
million of Brahmas, Vichnus, and a hundred thousand Ramas, stand
at the gate of the most High. These all perish. God alone is immortal.
Yet men who unite in the praise of God are not ashamed of living
in contention with each other, which proves that the evil spirit has
subdued all. He alone is a true Hindu whose heart is just, and he
only a good Muhammedan whose life is pure.”</p>

tank or reservoir of water, which is celebrated to our days under the

work as it now is. The Adi-granth is, like the rest of the books of the
Sikhs, written in the Gurumukh characters, which are a modified species
of the Nagari character. Arjunmal was put to death in 1606, by the

 The Jats inhabited in very ancient times the borders of the Indus in
the lower parts of Multan. There they were known to the Greek and
Latin writers, under the name of Calhæi, Malli, Oxidracæ as being without
a king, “<dfn>arattas</dfn>,” and divided into seven communities, who, united
by a common danger, resisted Alexander. In the same country they
opposed, 1300 years after the Macedonian invader, the irruption of Sultan
Muhammed, the Ghaznavid, by whom they were beaten near Multan on
the Indus. Inhabitants of mountains as well as of plains, they acted a
part in the many wars which took place on the western frontiers of India,
either as predatory hordes, or as allies, or as mercenaries of the belligerant
parties. During the ensuing disorders of the Indian empire, they
extended themselves towards the east of India, and became masters of
the mountainous district which is limited, on the east by the rivers Thambul
and Jumna; on the west, by the kingdom of Jâipur, which to the south
extends as far as twenty coss from Agra; and to the north borders on the

Thuraman, one of their leaders, laid the foundation of the fortress of

our days, as the capital seat of the Jats. They are Hindus of the fourth

 According to the Sketch of the Sikhs by General Malcolm, Arjunmal
was immediately succeeded by his son Har-govind, whilst the Dabistán
mentions his brother as his successor. There appears an hiatus, or some
confusion in our text; so much however is indicated clearly enough, that
there was a contest about the succession between the brother and the son
of Arjunmal.</p>

 Har-govind (<abbr title="General Malcolm">G. M.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 213) was a warlike Guru, or priest militant, and
wore two swords in his girdle. Being asked why he did so: “The one,”
said he, “is to revenge the death of my father; the other to destroy the
miracles of Muhammed.” His character appears in the Dabistán less
advantageously with respect to the religious customs of his sect, from the
austerity of which he is said to have greatly relaxed, and he permitted
the promiscuous use of flesh of all animals except that of the cow: his
military character however is maintained in all accounts of him.</p>

 The author of the Dabistán does not carry the account of the Sikhs
further than to the time of Harrayi, a peaceable Guru, who died in 1664.
After a contest between his sons, or, as some Sikh authors relate, between
his son, <span class="person">Har Krichna</span>, and his grandson, <span class="person">Ram Ray</span>, the former was
chosen. He died in 1664, and was succeeded by his uncle, <span class="person">Tégh Bahader</span>,
in spite of the opposition of his nephew, Ram Ray. Tégh Bahader was
imprisoned and put to death by the Muhammedans, in 1675. After his
death, the sect appeared crushed, but under his son, <span class="person">Gura Govind</span>, the
Sikhs rose again, no more as a sect, but as a nation endeavouring to establish
their independence. Guru Govind is considered by them as the
founder of their national greatness; he is the tenth, that is, their last
acknowledged religious ruler; he is the author of the <span class="title">Dasama Pádsháh-ka
grantha</span>, or “the book of the tenth king;” he changed the name of
his followers from Sikhs to <dfn>Singhs</dfn>, “lions,” who distinguished themselves
by a blue checkered dress; he first instituted the <dfn>Guru-mata</dfn>,
or “great council,” among them, and established the <dfn>Akalis</dfn>, or “the
immortals,” who preserved their name and consideration until our
days; in short, he sanctioned, and confirmed by institutions, the doctrine
taught by his predecessors, who endeavoured to separate the Sikhs from
the mass of the Hindus. Indeed “the admission of proselytes, the abolition
of the distinction of casts, the eating all kinds of flesh except that
of cows, the form of religious worship, and the general devotion of all
Sikhs to arms, are ordinances altogether irreconcileable with Hindu
mythology”&mdash;(<abbr title="General Malcolm">G. M.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 268).</p>

<p class="footnote">Guru Govind is supposed to have died in 1708, at Naded in the Deccan.
After him, <span class="person">Bandu</span>, a Váiragí, or ascetic, united the Sikhs under his banners:
during some time successful and formidable, he fell at last before
the power of the Muhammedans. Without pursuing the later history of the
Sikhs, I shall content myself with stating that they succeeded in forming in
our times, under their late Rája, Ranjet Singh, the kingdom of Lahore,
of four millions of inhabitants, dispersed over a surface of 70,000 square
miles, exclusively of the province of Kachmir, annexed to their dominions.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Of the religion of the Kerá Tabitian.</span></p>

<p class="p2">According to one of their treatises, they call God

and believe him to be one, infinite, all
mighty; they maintain his manifestation under
three forms, as the Hindus; they say, if any one
finds God, he converses with him without the aid of
a palate and of a tongue: this is the condition of a
prophet. They declare moreover that the spirit is
eternal, and that spirits are sent down; the soul, if
it knows itself and God, ascends to the upper world;
if not, it remains in the nether world. The author
of this book heard from one of their distinguished
personages that, when the rational soul separates
from this body, it goes to the upper world; and from
the heavens it rises further; and above this there is
a sea, in which is a mountain; and on its top God,
the supreme Lord, resides. If that soul has been
virtuous, the divinity manifests itself to it under a
pleasing form; so that from its aspect the soul derives
superlative delight, which no tongue can
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
express, and remains eternally without change,
happy and blissful in its contemplation. But if the
soul has been iniquitous, God appears to it under a
strange and terrific figure, than which none can be
more repulsive and hideous, so that from terror it
throws itself from the heavens down, and becomes
confined in dust. Among these sectaries was a man
called <span class="title">Pawn Pishna</span>, exceedingly pious. Of this saint’s
miracles they relate that, having jumped upon a
stone, the trace of his foot remained impressed upon
it, and now they perform pilgrimages to it. They
say further that, when this perfect man reaches the
term of his life, he convokes the people about him,
and out of the crowd he chooses one, to whom in
their presence he delivers his books and his effects,
and says: “I will come to thy house;” after that,
his soul leaves the body, which is buried according
to their customs. The wife of this guardian then
brings forth a son, whose tongue develops itself so
as to speak in one year, or sooner; he convokes
witnesses, and in their presence he takes the things
which are counted to him by the guardian, to whom
he then remits them again, and utters not a word
until the <em>usual</em> age of speech. When he attains the
period of adultness, he takes the state of a durvish.
They say that such an elect man comes into the
world for the conversion of wicked men. These
sectaries have temples of idols, which they call <span class="title">Chetharten</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_481" id="fnanchor_481"></a><a href="#footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></span>
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
and in which they perform their worship.
According to their custom, when a man has two
sons, he destines one of them to become a durvish;
and the king himself, having two sons, makes one
of them a durvish. They believe that there are two
mansions; the first of this, the second of the other,
world; the son who becomes a durvish takes possession
of the latter, the son who associates with
people of business acquires the portion of the nether
world; when the body of the father and mother
become weak and tottering from age, it is the
worldly son who tenders them his services; but
when the soul of the parents separates from the
body, it devolves upon the son who is a durvish to
serve them. When a great number of such young
durvishes assembles, then the son of the king, or of
any other chief becomes their head, and they go to
<span class="place">Bármîánek</span>, which is a magnificent temple of theirs.
When they return from this pilgrimage, they become
<dfn>Lámas</dfn>, that is, <dfn>Hájís</dfn>, “pilgrims.” The Lámas
abstain from eating flesh and from women, and keep
remote from all worldly affairs; they wear their hair
entangled, and eat from the skull of a man; they
carry joints of human hands filed together upon
a string, instead of a rosary;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_482" id="fnanchor_482"></a><a href="#footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></span>
and instead of horns
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">292</span>
for trumpets, they keep bones of human forearms;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_483" id="fnanchor_483"></a><a href="#footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></span>
they say: “We are dead; and dead men have nothing
to do with the things of the living.”</p>

 <div class="i0b">“We are gone, and we took a separate corner of a sepulchre,</div>
 <div class="i0">That our bones might not be a burden to any body’s shoulder.”</div>
</div>

<p>This class of men have not their equals in enchantments,
juggling, spells, and magic. Their king, if
his mother be not of royal blood, is by them called
<span class="title">Arghún</span>, and not considered their true king; whoever
of this sect belongs to the worldly people, does
not abstain from killing animals, eating flesh and
meats forbidden by religion, and associates with
every body in eating. When the author of this
book conversed with a learned man of this sect by
means of an interpreter, whenever a question about
some subtilty occurred, the translator could not

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2">From the book <span class="title">the Dabistán</span>, a short account of
the religion of the Yahuds, contained in two sections.</p>

<p><span class="decoration">Section the first</span>, the information received from the
tongue of Mohammed Sâíd Sarmed.</p>

<p><span class="decoration">Section the second</span>, upon the translation of the page
of Adam, which is the beginning of the book of
Moses (the Pentateuch).</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the First.</span>&mdash;The author of this book never
happened to have intercourse with learned and distinguished
men among the Yahuds; and he set no
value upon what he found in the books of foreigners
about their religion: because envy is a corrosion
and a fire, which attacks the enemy. But in the
year of the Hejira 1057 (A. D. 1647), when I came
to Hyder abad, I contracted friendship with <span class="person">Mohammed
Sâid Sarmed</span>, who was originally from a family
of learned Yahuds, of a class whom they call Rabánián
(Rabbins); after an investigation into the faith
of the Rabbins and the perusal of the Mosaic books,
he became a Muselman; he read the scientific works
of the wise men of Iran, such as Mulla Sader, and
Mír Abu-’l Kásem, of Kazer sak, and many others:
at last, for the sake of commerce, he undertook by
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
sea the voyage to Hindustan. When he arrived in
the town <span class="place">Tata</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_484" id="fnanchor_484"></a><a href="#footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></span>
he fell in love with a Hindu boy,
called Abhi Chand, and, abandoning all other things,
like a Sanyási, naked as he came from his mother,
he sat down before the door of his beloved. The
father of the object of his love, after having found by
investigation the purity of the attachment manifested
for his son, admitted Sarmed into his house,
and the young man too met him with an equal affection,
so that he could no more separate from him,
and he read the book of Moses, the psalms of David,
and other books with Sarmed. The following verses
are the composition of this young Hindu:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“I submit to Moses’ law; I am of thy religion, and the guardian of thy way:</div>
 <div class="i2">I am a Rabbi of the Yahuds, a Kafir, a Muselman.”</div>
</div>

<p>The learned rabbis say, according to their belief,
among the sons of Israel it was not required that
women should wear a dress, and Sarmed said that
Ishâiá, the prophet, himself used to go naked in his
last days. Sarmeda was a good master of poetry.
Here follow some of his verses:</p>

<p class="center small">RABAAI, QUATRAIN:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“Sarmed, whom they intoxicated from the cup of love,</div>
 <div class="i0">Whom they called, exalted, and depressed,</div>
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
 <div class="i0">Asked for wine, worship of God, and wisdom:</div>
 <div class="i0">(But) they intoxicated him, and made him a worshipper of idols.”</div>
</div>

<p>In the praise of the prophet, we find what follows:</p>

<p class="center small">QUATRAIN:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“O thou, by whose cheek is wounded the mind of the red rose,</div>
 <div class="i0">Internally is the whole blood of the heart, externally the red rose;</div>
 <div class="i0">Thou camest so late after Joseph, who was in the garden expecting thee,</div>
 <div class="i0">That the rose (of his cheek) became first yellow (from vexation) and at last (from pleasure) a red rose.”</div>
</div>

<p class="center small">ANOTHER QUATRAIN:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“This existence has, without the azure sphere, no reality,</div>
 <div class="i0">This existence is confined; for, except the absolute being, nothing has reality.</div>
 <div class="i2">Is God ever in vain? No! God is not in vain.</div>
 <div class="i0">This existence is real only with respect to its origin, but whatever is derived has no reality.”</div>
</div>

<p class="center small">ANOTHER QUATRAIN:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“When God weighed in the balance of destiny with the sun,</div>
 <div class="i0">The being endowed with every excellence, <span class="title">Muhammed</span>,</div>
 <div class="i0">This was so heavy that it moved not from its place;</div>
 <div class="i0">The other was so light that it flew up to heaven.”</div>
</div>

<p class="center small">A DISTICH.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i2">“Sarmed, who is a nightingale, has no desire of gold;</div>
 <div class="i0b">(But) his friend is the rose, and the rose has need of a handful of gold.”</div>
</div>

<p class="center small">ANOTHER DISTICH.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“In the Kâbah and in the idol temple is his stone <em>the symbol of male energy</em>, and his is <em>the symbol of female productiveness</em>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_485" id="fnanchor_485"></a><a href="#footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></span></div>
 <div class="i0">In one place it is the black stone <em>of the temple of Mecca</em>; in another place an idol of the Hindus.”</div>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
In the eulogy of Shaikh Mohammed Khan, who
was the chief minister of the illustrious Dara, Sultan
Abed Ullah Kat´eb, we find the following quatrain:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“O thou, who art the circumference of greatness to the centre of the throne!&mdash;</div>
 <div class="i0">Thou, to whose service a hundred persons are devoted, as is the firmament <em>to the universe</em>&mdash;</div>
 <div class="i0">Make thou to me, who am a stranger, my evening equal to midday,</div>
 <div class="i0">If at the side of Kateb<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_486" id="fnanchor_486"></a><a href="#footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></span>
thou art as happy as at midday.”</div>
</div>

<p>The Shaikh desired the society of Sarmed. The
author of this book was one day among the persons
present; he said to one called Jerán, who made the
eulogy of the Shaikh: “In a short time the Shaikh
will, with whatever he may have acquired, turn
towards the voyage of the other world, and Mîr
Mohammed Sâid Mîr will take complete possession
of the dignity of government;” and the same year
the Shaikh undertook to set out <em>for Mecca</em> from Hyderabad.
In the year of the Hejira 1059 (A. D. 1649),
in the harbor of Fahardanish, he passed from this
bodily ark to the circle of freedom. Hafiz says:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“The paradise of eternity is in this cell the share of the durvishes;</div>
 <div class="i0">The Kâbah of the universe is the dominion of the durvishes;</div>
 <div class="i0">O my heart, be there with reverence: for the sultan and the country</div>
 <div class="i0">All are in the service of the majesty of the durvishes.”</div>
</div>

<p>Sarmed gave the information that, according to
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
the Yahuds, God, the Almighty, is corporeal; and
that his body is after the image of mankind, and
similar to it; that, during the course of time, he is
dispersed in the same manner as splendor is dissipated.
Sarmed moreover said, that it is mentioned
in the Mosaic book and in the holy writings, that
the spirit of the divine body is beauty itself, and
manifests itself under a human form; that punishment
and recompense of the other world are already
experienced in this state; that life lasts one hundred
and twenty years; after that, man’s whole life may
be considered as one day, which, when he dies, is
followed by night; that his body assumes partly the
form of a mineral, partly that of a vegetable, and
partly that of an animal, and the like; when one
hundred and twenty years have elapsed, night comes
to an end, and the morning appears again; if an
atom of his bodily dust be in the east and another
atom in the west, they unite in one place, and life
is renewed to last again one hundred years, as we
have said, when night returns. Punishment and
recompense are solely for this world. They maintain
that whatever is, bears eternally the form of
mankind, composed of water and earth.</p>

<p>The Yahuds agree in denying the appearance of
<span class="person">Aisia</span> (Jesus) <span class="person">as a prophet</span>; they say that he was a
deceiver; and they reject what the <dfn>Aisuyan</dfn>, “Christians,”
adduce from the Old Testament about the
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
appearance of Aísya; they maintain that the prophet
Ishâía spoke of himself the words<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_487" id="fnanchor_487"></a><a href="#footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></span>
which have been
applied to Aísya. They assert that Ibrâhím was no
prophet, but a holy man, and they esteem a holy
man higher than a prophet. They say that, in the
Mosaic book, no mention is made of Pharâún’s pretensions
to be a god; but they relate that this king
was a tyrant who oppressed the children of Israel,
wherefore Musiâ (Moses) rose, and protested against
his tyranny. As Pharâún did not attend to his
words, he met with his fate. They also say that it
is not to be found in the sacred book that Harun
(Aaron) was joined to Musiâ in the divine mission,
although he acted as his substitute. They agree in
saying that Dáúdâ (David) sent Urîa to be killed,
because the king coveted the possession of that
man’s wife, whom he took afterwards, and hence
Solíman was begotten. They further insist that
Aísia was no prophet, as the Nazaréans believe.
Dáudâ said: “My hands and feet will fall, and my
bones have been counted;” all this was fulfilled
at the time when Aísia suffered death; but they
<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">299</span>
assert that Dáúda spoke those words of himself, and
in such manner all things which the Nazáréans set
forth about Aísia, the Yahuds interpret clearly in
another sense. It is besides written in their sacred
book that, when the children of Isráîl shall perform
iniquitous acts, Muhammad will appear. About
this, Sarmed said that, although the name of the
prophet is in the sacred book, yet another meaning
may more evidently be attached to it; but if even
the prophet’s very name be insisted upon, it has no
other import but that it exhorts the children of
Isrâíl to convert themselves to his religion, and, in
such an endeavour, carried beyond all bounds, he
said many other things.</p>

<p>The Yahuds receive no stranger into their community;
circumcision is the law of their prophet,
not that of others. They say also that a prophet
is always living and present, to be the propagator
of the law which is contained in the sacred book.
<span class="person">Abhî Chand</span>, having translated a part of the Mosaic

they corrected it completely, affixed their mark

<p>The Dabistan gives here a Persian translation of the Genesis,
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">300</span>
from the beginning to chapter VI, verse 8; at the end
of which the author says that this is the only portion of the
sacred book of the Jews which he had an opportunity of
examining. According to Eichhorn (see Einleitung in das alte
Testament, 4th <abbr title="edition, volume Two, page">edit., vol. II. p.</abbr> 329) the five books of Moses
were translated into Persian by the rabbi Jacob, son of Joseph,
after the ninth century; the translation contained in the
Dabistan is said to have been executed by Abhi Chand;
we cannot say whether it was made from the Hebrew original,
or from the Arabic, or any other language. We are
informed by the baron Hammer-Purgstall (see <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gemaldesaal
moslimisher Herrsher</span>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 57) that Werka ben Nafil, a
cousin of Khadija, Muhammed’s wife, and a Christian priest,
translated the Old and New Testament from the Hebrew
into Arabic; this translation appears however to have been
but little known. Eichhorn says (loco citato, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 231), that
the first certain traces of a translation of the Hebrew sacred
books into Arabic are to be found in the tenth century.
Pocock mentions (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 34, 361) Sâadias, a learned Jew, who
lived from 892 to 941 A. D., as translator of all the books
of the Old Testament into Arabic; and another Jew (not
named) who made a version of the book of Kings into the same
language.</p>

<p>The Persian translation of the fragment under our consideration
was revised by the author of the Dabistan, and by
Sarmed, who was a Jew and a Rabbin, converted to Muhammedism,
most probably in the first half of the seventeenth
century. As it was undoubtedly executed from another original
copy than that which had served to the translators in
Europe, it appeared interesting enough to examine whether
the Persian version of the Dabistan differs in any material
point from the translations known in Europe. For that purpose
I have consulted the following copies of the Bible:</p>

it is exhibited without a due distinction of the different Jewish

 The author leaves us in a total uncertainty about the words to which
he alludes; if to those of Isaiah, <abbr title="chapter 53, verses">chap. LIII, vv.</abbr> 2-12, the prophet would
have predicted his own sufferings. According to the learned Jew, Isaac
Orobio (see <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Israel vengé, ou Exposition naturelle des Prophéties que les
Chrétiens appliquent à Jésus, leur prétendu Messie</cite>), the words of Isaiah,

in the 42nd year of the reign of Cæsar
<span class="person">Tiberius</span>. When Aísía appeared, the high priest said:
“We charge thee, upon thy oath by the living God,
say, art thou the son of God?” The blessed and
holy Lord Aísîâ replied to him: “I am what thou
hast said. Verily, we say unto you, you shall
see the son of man seated at the right hand of
God, and he shall descend in the clouds of heaven.”
They said: “Thou utterest a blasphemy,
because, according to the creed of the Yahuds,
God never descends in the clouds of heaven.”
Ishâîá the prophet has announced the birth of Aîsîá
in words the translation of which is as follows: “A
branch from the root of Ishaî shall spring up, and
from this branch shall come forth a flower in
which the spirit of God shall dwell: verily, a
virgin shall be pregnant and bring forth a son.”
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">307</span>
Isháî is the name of the father of Dávid. When they
had apprehended Aisîa, they spit upon his blessed
face and smote him. Ishâa had predicted it: “I
shall give up my body to the smiters, and my
cheek to the diggers <em>of wounds</em>; I shall not turn
my face from those who will use bad words, and
throw spittle upon me.” When Aflátes (Pilatus),
a judge of the Yahuds, scourged the Lord Aîsiâ in
such a manner that his body from head to foot
became but one wound, so was it as Ishâía had predicted:
“He was wounded for our transgressions;
I struck him for his people.” When Pilatus saw
that the Yahuds insisted upon the death and the
crucifixion of Jesus, he said: “I take no part in the
blood of this man; I wash my hands clean of this
blood.” The Yahuds answered: “His blood be
on us and on our children.” On that account, the
Yahuds are oppressed and curbed down, in retribution
of their iniquities. When they had placed the
cross upon the shoulder of Aísiá, and led him to die,
a woman wiped with the border of her garment the
face, full of blood, of the Lord Aîsîa; verily, she
obtained three images of it, and carried them home:
the one of these images exists still in Ispániah, in
the royal town which is situated within the country
of the king of Portugal; and is shown there twice
every year:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_494" id="fnanchor_494"></a><a href="#footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></span>

 The viscount of Santarem, to whose most extensive learning in
history and geography, I fortunately had an opportunity in Paris of
applying for information upon the above mentioned fact, gave me the
following notice: “In no town of Portugal do I find any indication of
the existence of these relics. I think that there is, in the statement of
the Dabistán, an error and a confusion with the fact related by Brandâo,
in 1643, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: the famous Portuguese prince don Pietro, son of
John <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, having, on his return from Jerusalem to Spain, in 1428, married
in the town of Alcoba in Catalonia, the countess Isabella, daughter of
D. Jayme, count of Urgel, gave to the bishop of Valenza an image of our
Saviour, taken by St. Veronica. These relics were still preserved in
the cathedral of Valenza in Spain, called by distinction ‘the royal
town,’ in the year 1643.” It was a few years after this (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 305),
that the author of the Dabistán might have received from father Francia,
the Portuguese missionary, the account above stated.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the second: of the creed of the Ai su yah</span>
(<span class="sc">Christians</span>). They say that, in the name of God
the Father, God the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
every one ought to bear in his heart and to keep
perpetually on his tongue the Lord Jesus, the Son
of God, and never to deny him, if even it were at
the peril of his head.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_495" id="fnanchor_495"></a><a href="#footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></span>
The holy cross is the sign
of the Christians. They reckon fourteen parts of
their creed: seven of which relate to God the Almighty,
and seven to the human nature of the Lord
Jesus. The first seven are as follow: 1. to confess
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
that God is omnipotent and supreme; 2. to believe
that he is the Father; 3. to believe that he is the
Son; 4. that he is a pure spirit; 5. that he is the
Creator; 6. that he bestows heaven; 7. that he
grants salvation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_496" id="fnanchor_496"></a><a href="#footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></span>
The seven other articles, which
relate to the human nature of Jesus are the following:
1. to believe that he is the Son of God, by the
power of the Holy Ghost, born in the body of Maria;
2. that he was born of Maria, the virgin, and without
detriment to her virginity; 3. that for our sake he
was crucified, died, and was buried; 4. that he shall
descend from heaven, and raise up the former generations,
who there anxiously expected his blessed
arrival; 5. that he resuscitated on the third day;
6. that he ascended to heaven, and sits at the right
hand of the Father, the omnipotent and supreme
God; 7. that he shall come at the end of the world
to judge the living and the dead, and to reveal their
good and bad actions. They call God a father, because
he is bountiful to his servants as a father to
his children. They maintain that, although God
has three different persons, yet, in truth, he is but
one being; in such a manner that the persons are
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, without
the unity of the blessed entity being affected by it,
and this peculiarity belongs to the divinity; in no
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
creature is such an attribute to be found. Jesus is
in truth the Son of God; it is only metaphorically
that other holy personages are called the sons of
God; it is in an abstract sense,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_497" id="fnanchor_497"></a><a href="#footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></span>
inasmuch as, being
God, that Jesus came forth in heaven from the Father,
not from the mother; in a similar manner, in an
abstract sense, inasmuch as, being a man upon earth,
he has a mother, but no Father. Jesus did not die,
but, having a perfect love for the sons of Adam, he
sacrificed himself for the people, that they may be
liberated again from all sins. They say further, that
below the earth there are four places: the undermost
of all is hell, which is the place of severe punishment
for the Satans and the iniquitous. Another
place, above this, is that which they call <dfn>purgatory</dfn>,
that is, a place of purification for good men, as some
of the disobedient who have rebelled, when they
shall have there been purified, go to heaven. A
third place, higher than the last, is called the <dfn>limbus</dfn>,
in which are children under age; except that of
being deprived of the sight of the Lord Almighty,
they are there exempt from all other suffering.
The fourth place is the most elevated of all; they
call it “the House of Ibrahîm,” that is, the dwelling
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">311</span>
of the souls of the prophets and holy men: these
were formerly not quite happy, because they expected
anxiously the arrival of the Saviour, the Lord
Jesus; when Jesus left the body which was buried,
he descended to this fourth place, and when he rose
from the grave, he brought the pure souls with him,
leaving the souls in the three other places where
they were. When, after having been put to death,
he was restored to life, his soul was reunited to his
body, and he remained forty days with his disciples;
he then, before their eyes and those of others,
ascended to heaven, and, in the highest place, seated
himself at the side of God Almighty. They declare:
“When we say that Jesus is seated at the right side
of God, his Father, we mean not to say that God
has a body and is any thing corporeal. No! the
Divine Being has neither right nor left side. By
such a description we intend to be intelligible <em>to
the vulgar</em>; for Jesus, in the abstract sense of being
the son of God, possesses the same greatness and
power which his Father has, and in the abstract
sense of his being a man, he dwells in the most
glorious and most excellent place, which is in
heaven.” They declare further: “When we say
that Jesus shall come on the last day of the world
to judge the dead and the living, and to give their
due to all men, we mean not to imply that all
men will then be alive, but by the living we denote
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>
the good men, and by the dead, the wicked.”
Except Christians, nobody else will be found pure
and holy. On the day of resurrection, all men shall
live and their souls shall be reunited to their bodies,
and none will ever more die.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the third: of the works of the Christians.</span>&mdash;Ten
commandments are established in the
Gospel; three of them relate to God, and seven
others to the servants of God: 1. thou shalt love
the Lord thy God above all things; 2. thou shalt
not swear by the name of God for the sake of an
argument, that is, thou shalt accustom thyself to the
truth; when this quality shall be manifest in thee,
thou wilt never have occasion for an oath. The
wise master of secrets, the king Naser Khusró says:</p>

<p class="center small">“At any time speak nothing else but truth, that thou mayst not have
need of an oath.”</p>

<p class="unindent">3. keep the holy days, that is the Sunday and the
other sanctified days; 4. honor thy father and thy
mother; 5. thou shalt not kill: this means, evidently,
thou shalt not kill a living being at all;
but they have interpreted it that only the animal
which is a <em>private</em> property ought not to be killed,
such a one as is serviceable, and in life, or after
death, may be of use. The true sense is, that we
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
ought not only not to kill our brother (and such is
any son of Adam), but even not hurt him by any
deed or word; 6. thou shalt not commit fornication,
that is, with a woman not thy own, be she
married or without a husband; 7. thou shalt not
steal; 8. thou shalt not calumniate nor lie: in this
command enters that, if any thing bad concerning
somebody be a secret, although we know it as a
certainty, we ought nevertheless to keep it concealed,
and not to divulge it, except the bad thing
were against religion and faith, or tended against
the king; 9. thou shalt not covet another’s wife;
10. thou shalt not covet another’s good.</p>

<p>The other five commandments, which are less
imperative, are: 1. to hear mass on Sunday, and on
other holy days; and this is a rite of devotion which
a padri performs; and every body ought in solitude
to turn his whole mind towards the remembrance
of the sufferings of Jesus; 2. every one ought to go
to confession at least once a year. The confession
implies three conditions: the first is truth; the second,
contrition; the third, completeness; that is,
to recount humbly one’s own sins without diminution
or addition, to speak out, and to beg absolution;
3. it is necessary that every one should take,
yearly, the communion at the Easter feast, that is,
when Jesus attained to manhood and made his testament,
establishing the rule of the holy sacrament,
<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
which is a worship; 4. let every man keep the fast
at Christmas, and other fasts, except a person be
excused; 5. it is obligatory to pay the tithes, that is,
the tenth part of whatever grows from the earth, or
comes forth from an animal, is to be given to God.</p>

<p>At the time of prayer, they say, God is to be invoked
as our Father; he loveth us just as a father
loveth a son, and his own Son says and orders that
we should call him a father. We ought then to
abstain from sins, that he may enable us to be his
children. And when we say to God: “thou art in
heaven,” it is because we think he has chosen
heaven, and for that reason we raise our hearts from
the earth upwards, if even God has no dwelling so as
to be beheld in heaven. Besides, in their prayer,
they do not demand bread from God, because he is
displeased at our wanting to-day the necessaries of
life for a future day, but because he wills us to be
contented, and to feel no anxious care about to-morrow.
They say, that we ought to pardon the mischief
that we receive from others, in order that God
Almighty may also pardon our transgressions.
They offer likewise prayers in praise of the glorious
Mary, saying that the Lord God diffuses abundantly
his grace in any place in which the image of the
blessed Lady Mary be present. In the same manner
they consider the image of the Lord Jesus, and
that of the holy cross.</p>

<p><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
There are seven sacraments, which consist in
submissive prayers and invocations for remission of
sins from God the Almighty: 1. <dfn>Baptism</dfn>; that is, an
external ablution in the name of God, of his Son,
and of the Holy Ghost; for this act any sort of water
that may be procured is acceptable; by this act the
soul is purified from the contamination of all sins;
this rite may be performed by the first padri who
may be present, and if none are at hand, by any
individual among the Christians; 2. <dfn>Confirmation</dfn>;
that is, a friction with holy oil, given in the name
of God; and the giver, that is, a padri of known
merit, bestows it on all Christians of an adult age;
<dfn>Sanct-Eucharisty</dfn>: this, they say, is the holiest of
all the sacraments, as it presents the Lord Jesus
under the form of bread, that he may become the
power of the soul. Three conditions are required
in this act: the first is a true faith; the second,
abstinence from sins; the third, to fast, and eat
nothing until taking the sacrament; the time of taking
it is Christmas; 4. <dfn>Penitence</dfn>; which consists of two
conditions that the Lord Jesus has imposed therein:
the first is confession; that is the avowal made by
the sinner of his sins, and the absolution of the padri,
as of one who is the substitute of Jesus, and whose
forgiveness is the absolution of Jesus. Then, it is
necessary that the sinner should give a detailed
account of his concealed and open crimes, and to this
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span>
he must add two things; the one is an aversion to,
and a repentance of, every action which he may have
done without the approbation of God; the other is
a sincere resolution of never undertaking any blamable
acts; to execute faithfully the penance imposed
upon him by the padri, as Jesus ordered a return
for every crime. Further, whatever sins, venial or
capital, may have struck the ear of the padri, he
ought never, even at the peril of his head, to reveal
or publish them; 5. <dfn>Sacrament of extreme unction</dfn>;
this is a friction by which they anoint a Christian
with holy oil, and they bestow this sacrament
with some words which the Lord Jesus has spoken.
The above five sacraments are obligatory to every
adult Christian; 6. <dfn>Ordination</dfn>; this sacrament is
taken by devoting one’s self by free choice to the
worship of God, which vocation the Christians
recommend; 7. <dfn>Matrimony</dfn>; this is an agreement
which a man and a woman take together at the time
of their binding themselves in wedlock, that during
the whole of their life they will keep faith to each
other. This is peculiar to the adults. This act is
allowable to women frequently at the age of twelve
years; to men at that of fourteen. The man is not
permitted to take more than one wife, and the woman
is bound to a single husband. The padri who
gives this sacrament, after having ascertained that
there is no objection to the marriage, and the compact
<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">317</span>
being made before witnesses, unites both to
each other in wedlock according to the conditions
of matrimony.</p>

<p>The Christians say that faith is something by
which we know a religion to be certainly true, and
that, whenever God, the Almighty, has sent his
message, however hard and difficult, and out of the
natural mode and rule it may appear, we know that
God cannot tell a lie. The truth is found in the
book of God, by means of the evidence given by
him who is the substitute of the Lord Jesus, and
whom they call <span class="title">Pope</span>. It is certain that he throws
nobody into an error, because the Lord Jesus has
in the holy Gospel, made an arrangement with him
to that effect. It should be known that the life of
man depends upon these laudable qualifications. To
search and to acquire knowledge is a laudable intention,
in every business and profession; on that
account it is by method and virtue that affairs find a
proper arrangement; knowledge is the master of
things; it is like salt in meat, it is the eye of the
body; and as the sun in heaven. <dfn>Justice</dfn> consists
in using moderation in the manifold transactions
of men, and in keeping men in peace and in mutual
satisfaction: if therefore every body were contented
with his share, and entertained no desire for more,
there would be no war and contention. <dfn>Fortitude</dfn> is
something by means of which one obtains superiority
<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
over the difficulties which obstruct the life of
men, and the business of fortitude is to triumph over
terror and fear, which Iblis (Satan) throws into the
heart, in order to retain us from acts which are to
be done. <dfn>Continence</dfn> is a faculty which bestows
measure and order in sensual pleasures; the business
of continence is to prevent men from being
carried away by the delights of the world; we ought
to tend in this life towards godliness; blessed are
those who feel hunger and thirst after God. It is
required that, in our devotion to God there enters
no other desire but that of the beatitude to see the
Divine Being; on that account blessed are those
whose hearts are pure, because the sight of God
shall be their reward in heaven, and even in this
world they shall in a certain way see God: because
those whose eyes are pure, behold things of <em>superlative</em>
beauty; it is required that we carry strife to a
peaceful end, and accomplish our virtuous endeavors.
Those who are in a state of opposition to
this, take with efforts and struggles the road of
misery. On that account blessed are the peace-makers,
for they shall be called the children of God.</p>

<p>There are fourteen gifts of God, the all merciful;
seven of them are bodily, and seven spiritual. The
seven bodily gifts are: 1. to satiate the hungry;
2. to quench the thirst of the thirsty; 3. to clothe
the naked; 4. to harbor the stranger; 5. to inquire
<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pageno">319</span>
after the sick, and to console the captive; 6. to
procure liberty to prisoners; 7. to bury the dead.
The spiritual acts are as follow: 1. to instruct the
ignorant; 2. to advise the poor <em>in spirit</em>; 3. to comfort
the heart of the mourners; 4. to admonish the
sinners; 5. to forgive injuries inflicted; 6. to show
forbearance to the deformities of nature; 7. to offer
pious prayers for the living and the dead. The
Christians say that every necessitous individual is
worthy of charities, to whatever religion or sect he
may belong, but the person of the same faith, or a
relative, is more deserving of favor. It is a sin,
when by choice we perpetrate an action which is in
opposition to the pleasure of God, and when we
abandon an act which we are commanded to perform.
A capital sin is it for a man, by his own
choice, to commit an abominable act and deed, such
as the unrighteous spilling of blood, and whoredom.
Of venial sins seven are enumerated: such as stealing
some slight thing without a perfect concurrence
of the will in it. The summary of the capital sins
is as follows: pride, avarice, lust, anger, gluttony,
envy, and sloth.</p>

<p>Pride consists in esteeming one’s self higher than
others, whence proceed petulance, which displays
itself in vaunting one’s self and despising others, and
in dispute, and disobedience. The remedies to be
applied to it are trust, submission, and obedience to
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pageno">320</span>
another; these are suitable means by which the
hateful mind may be subdued.</p>

<p>Avarice is a desire without measure of the brittle
things of the world, and the bad consequences which
result from it are theft, deception in buying and
selling, lies, and perjury: the remedies for it may be
good works and liberality.</p>

<p>Lust is an unbounded desire of sensual pleasures;
but the way and scandalous display of it is
the defilement of women: the remedy to be sought
for counteracting it is chastity.</p>

<p>Anger is a desire without measure of vengeance
upon somebody, and the display of it is hatred of
God’s creatures, insulting speeches against men,
contentions, and a total want of mildness: the remedies
for it are patience, forbearance, and the reflection
that, for our crimes and shameful acts, we are
deserving of the adversity which comes upon us,
and to keep before our sight the Lord Jesus and
his apostles, who showed nothing but mercy and
kindness to those very men who caused their distress
and affliction.</p>

<p>Gluttony is a desire without measure of eating and
drinking; the offspring of this is sensuality, rejection
of fasts, slowness in worship, and all sorts of diseases
ruining the body: the remedies for this are
abstinence, moderation in eating and drinking, in
order that a becoming attention to divine favor be
<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pageno">321</span>
excited, the constitution restored to health, and a
return from all extravagance accomplished.</p>

<p>Envy is a pain and sadness derived from the good
condition of the affairs of other people; whence
proceeds the jealous intention to find fault and occasion
for detraction. It displays itself by rejoicing at
the distress of one’s neighbors, when related by other
tongues, by reviling certain people, and by leading
an unprofitable life: the remedy for it is affection
for mankind on account of their being God’s creatures,
and to consider that happiness and welfare are
bestowed upon them by the mercy of God, and that
it is an exceeding offence against good morals to be
afflicted on account of the works and effects which
result from <em>divine</em> disposition.</p>

<p>Sloth is negligence in the worship of God and in
good behaviour. It displays itself by a frequent
deficiency in laudable and obligatory actions, and in
always letting slip out of our hands the expedients
of spiritual and material life: the remedy for it is
activity and alacrity.</p>

<p>Hell is a place a worse than which cannot exist,
and in this abode one is imprisoned to all eternity,
on account of commission of sins for punishment,
more severe than which none can be imagined.
Heaven is a place full of all sorts of delight; the
happiness of this place manifests itself for all ages
by jubilation and pleasure.</p>

<p><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>
Jesus told his disciples: “After me, a great number
of men will set forth pretensions to divine
mission, but all will be deceivers: remain you
persevering and steady in your adherence to me,
until my coming.”</p>

<p>The Gospel has been translated from the tongue
of Jesus into different languages; namely, into Arabic,
Greek, Latin, which last is the language of the
learned among the Firang; into Syriac, and this all
men of letters know.</p>

<p class="hanging">Of the religion of the Muhammedans, or of the
people of Islám (right faith), consisting of two
sections: the first treats of the religion of the
<span class="title">Sonnites</span>, the second of the religion of the <span class="title">Shiâs</span>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section the first: of the religion of the Sonnites.</span>&mdash;The
author of this book was informed by
respectable persons of the Sonnites (the mercy of
God be upon them!) and saw in their books, namely,
in the doctrine presented by the imam <span class="person">Mohammed
Sheh eristanî</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_498" id="fnanchor_498"></a><a href="#footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></span>
where it is said, that in sign of revelation
<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pageno">323</span>
the verses of the high prophet (upon whom be
blessing!) show the right faith; that his religion will
divide into seventy and three sects,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_499" id="fnanchor_499"></a><a href="#footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></span>
and that of this
number one shall obtain salvation, and the rest shall
share darkness and perdition. It was asked: “Upon
what people shall the sun of salvation shine?” He
answered: “It shall shine upon the people of the
<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">324</span>
<span class="title">Sonat</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_500" id="fnanchor_500"></a><a href="#footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></span>
and <span class="title">Jamáât</span>.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_501" id="fnanchor_501"></a><a href="#footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></span>
It was further asked: “Who
are the people of Sonat<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_502" id="fnanchor_502"></a><a href="#footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></span>
and Jamáât?” He said:
“Those who walk the road upon which I am to-day
a traveller, and by which my successor shall proceed.”
The same book treats also of the <span class="title">Sifátîah</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_503" id="fnanchor_503"></a><a href="#footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></span>
a great number of which sect has from all times
acknowledged the greatness of the divine nature,
whose attributes are omniscience, power, life, hearing,
sight, providence, command, majesty, bounty,
profuse liberality, greatness, and magnificence; they
make no difference between the <em>essential attributes</em> and
the <em>attributes of operation</em>; because in logic, according
<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pageno">325</span>
to their definition of the words, both these attributes
are but one; they maintain that some of the attributes
are proclaimed by the evidence of the blessed
revelation; and these they call <dfn>attributes declarative</dfn>:
for instance, the hand, the countenance; these they
do not interpret in a particular sense, but they say,
these attributes are found mentioned in the sacred
book, on which account these attributes are called
<dfn>declarative</dfn>. Whereas the sect called the <span class="title">Mâtazalah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_504" id="fnanchor_504"></a><a href="#footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></span>
deny the attributes, and the ancients maintain them
by arguments; the latter are called <span class="title">Sifátiah</span>, and the
Mâtezalah are entitled <span class="title">Mâtalah</span>; but these last employ
<a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pageno">326</span>
exaggeration in their arguments to such a degree
that they approach the boundary of a mere image.
Some use more restriction with respect to the attribution,
which is indicated by the actions <em>of God</em>.
Information derived from the sacred book devolved
equally to both sects; but some interpret these
words in a manner that they may appear probable,
whilst others are firm in their interpretation, saying:
“We know by the application of the intellect
that nothing can be like the Lord’s divine power,
and that at all times nothing of what is created
can be like him, and firmly convinced of it, we
think these words are to be considered as a mere
simile, such as: ‘<cite>God seated upon his throne</cite>,’ or
such as ‘<cite>I created you with my hand, and I preserve
you</cite>.’ Except these words, which are to be
considered as a mere simile, we know no other
meaning, and to know <em>thoroughly</em> the meaning and
interpretation of it, we feel ourselves perplexed;
but, in spite of this perplexity, we deny the likeness
of the created beings and the Creator, on
account of the extent of the divine power.”</p>

<p>The sect called <span class="title">Jamáâtî</span>, which belongs to the
moderns, amplified what the ancients had maintained,
and said, that necessarily an evident sense is
to be ascribed to these words, and by means of a
commentary an agreement was obtained upon the
proper bearing which the text of the sacred book
<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pageno">327</span>
has, so that we may without difficulty interpret it,
or establish the evident meaning of it. They always
fell into a pure simile, and in such an acceptation,
they are in opposition to the ancients. Whatever,
as a pure simile, is taken from the sacred book of
the Jews, this is also not received by all the Jewish
tribes, although the readers of the Koran, having
found some such words in the Old Testament, employ
the simile as an argument, and in this belief are
the <span class="title">Shîâh</span>. Some fell upon the side of excess, and
some upon that of deficiency; but others of the
sect, which by exaggeration<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_505" id="fnanchor_505"></a><a href="#footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></span>
exceeded all bounds,
declared as vain any comparison with the Lord Almighty,
whilst the sect which happened to take the
side of deficiency and error compared something
which is created to the Lord God. When the <dfn>Mâtazalah</dfn>
and the <dfn>Matakalmán</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_506" id="fnanchor_506"></a><a href="#footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></span>
“scholastics,” appeared,
then some openly turned their face from exaggeration
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pageno">328</span>
and deficiency in which they were, and became
<span class="title">Mâtazalah</span>. And some of the ancients, inasmuch as
they attached themselves to the imagery of certain
words which are to be considered as a mere simile,
fell into an error; but the sect of the ancients in
general did not oppose the interpretation of those
words, and made themselves no objects of contention
and blame on account of the simile. It was the
example of the theologians and of the Imáms of the
right faith, the Imám <span class="person">Ans</span> Ebn <span class="person">Málik</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_507" id="fnanchor_507"></a><a href="#footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></span>
(the peace of
God be upon him!) who said that the words: “<cite>God
was seated upon his throne</cite>,” are evident; the attribute
is unknown, and the faith to be placed in it is
necessary. The question thereupon being a novelty,
and carried to such a state, the Imáms <span class="person">Ahmed Hanbal</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_508" id="fnanchor_508"></a><a href="#footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></span>
<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pageno">329</span>
and <span class="person">Dáúd Jśfaháni</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_509" id="fnanchor_509"></a><a href="#footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></span>
(the mercy of God be upon
them!) and the Jamáâtî, who followed them, came to
a final conclusion, until the time of <span class="person">Abd-Alah Kalabî</span>,
and <span class="person">Abî al Abas Kalánasî</span>, and <span class="person">Háres Jben Asad Mahásebi</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_510" id="fnanchor_510"></a><a href="#footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></span>
Although these were of the ancients, it happened
that, by devoting themselves to scholastic theology,
they became inflamed with it, but were not
able to expound the creed of the ancients; in such a
manner as to impart, by means of arguments, clearness
<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pageno">330</span>
to the fundamentals of theology, and their
fervor and activity became doubled and increased,
until by the intervention of the Shaikh <span class="person">Abu ’l Hasen
Asharî</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_511" id="fnanchor_511"></a><a href="#footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></span>, and by his instruction in the precepts of
rectitude and perfection an opposition appeared, and
a dispute arose, and enmity displayed itself. Ashâri
inclined to their side, and by opening roads to the
fundamentals of theology, he lent strength to their
endeavors, and this creed became the religion of the
<span class="title">Sonnites</span> and the <span class="title">Jamáât</span>. The title of <span class="title">Sifátíah</span>, which
they bore as a title of honor, was changed, and
they called themselves <span class="title">Ashârî</span>. As the <span class="title">Ashârîáh</span> and
<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pageno">331</span>
<span class="title">Keramiah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_512" id="fnanchor_512"></a><a href="#footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></span>
are among the establishers of the divine
attributes, they are acknowledged as two sects of
the totality of the Sifátîah. The principal point
among the precepts of the Ashârîs is, that every
being that may <em>really</em> exist must be perfect, that
it may answer its own purpose; perfection is a
necessity of existence, and the Lord Almighty is
the <em>real</em> being: the necessity of the Lord God is
always right, and the law by him is a salvation
acquired, so that the faithful believers shall in
the other world, by a beneficent necessity, become
exalted:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">“God said: ‘Some countenances shall on that day look towards their

</div>

<p>They say besides, that if he gave access to heaven
to all creatures, or sent them to hell, it would not
be unjust; because tyranny can be exercised every
where except in his empire. They maintain also,
that the office of an Imam becomes firm by union
and election, not only by manifestation and establishment:
<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><span class="pageno">332</span>
because, if there was manifestation, it
did not remain occult, and the excitements occasioned
by the report of it were abundant. Upon the
plank of the children of Sáâdah<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_514" id="fnanchor_514"></a><a href="#footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></span>
they united to elect
<span class="person">Abubeker</span>; after having established Abubeker, they
chose <span class="person">Omar</span>; and after consultation <span class="person">Osman</span>, and afterwards
their choice fell upon <span class="person">Alî</span> (the blessing of God,
the Highest, be upon them all!). The order of their
succession in the office of Imam was according to
the order of their excellence.</p>

<p>An example of what was said about the ancients
is to be found among the possessors of the sacred
sayings, the Imam Ahmed Hanbal<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_515" id="fnanchor_515"></a><a href="#footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></span>
and Dáúd Ebn
Ali Muhammed Jsfahánî<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_516" id="fnanchor_516"></a><a href="#footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></span>
and the Jamáâtî of the
ancients (the blessing of God be upon them!) who
proceeded as leaders upon the high road of the ancients,
such as Málik Ans and Makábil Ben Solîman,
and persevered upon the high road of peace, saying:
“We made oath by the book and the Sonna, and we
were no opposers to the interpretation;” therefore
they placed confidence in the book of God, and
the Sonnites said: “We know that the Lord Almighty
is not like any thing that is created, and
none of the created beings is like the Lord Almighty;”
and they were very careful of the simile,
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pageno">333</span>
and said: “Whoever makes a motion with his hand
in reciting these words:</p>

<p class="blockquote">‘I created with my hands,’</p>

<p class="unindent">“or extends his finger, repeating these words of
the sacred sayings:</p>

<p class="blockquote">‘The heart of the believer is between two fingers of God the Merciful.’</p>

<p class="unindent">“it shall be necessary to cut off his hand.” They
said besides: ”We persevere in the interpretation
of it, because there is a remedy for the heart, which
remedy proceeded from the heavenly revelation;
namely,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“They whose hearts are inclined to error will follow that which
is parabolical therein (the Koran), out of love of schism and a desire
of the interpretation thereof; yet none knoweth the interpretation
thereof, except God. But they who are well grounded in knowledge
say: ‘We believe therein the whole is from our Lord.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_517" id="fnanchor_517"></a><a href="#footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>“And we are safe from doubt, and the interpretation
of the command is fixed in our thought; by common
consent the word about the attributes of God
Almighty, interpreted according to opinion, is not
to be depended upon; it may sometimes happen
that we interpret it contrarily to the will of the
Lord God; we always fall into doubt and some
deviation from truth; but we say what the men
firm in knowledge say: that the whole is from the
Lord, the Almighty God; we manifested this
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pageno">334</span>
belief externally, and internally we acknowledged
it as true; we consign it to the Lord, the Almighty
God, and we are not perplexed by the
abstruseness of this knowledge, because to possess
it, is not imposed upon us by the law of the
faith.” Some have carried scrupulousness to
that degree, that they do not interpret in Persian
the words “hand, countenance, and strength;”
but, like the <span class="title">Hashaviyat Ashâriah</span>, they enjoined that
whatever is contained in the Koran about strength,
both hands, countenance, arrival, meeting, supremacy,
and the words in the sacred sayings, such as:</p>

<p class="center small">“God created Adam after his own image.”</p>

<p class="unindent">and other expressions therein of a similar sort, are
to be read in the very terms of the original, so that
the words which there openly bear upon solid bodies,
are understood by them in such a manner as to
answer the belief of the religious sects and the attribution.</p>

<p>The author of this book heard, in the year of the
Hejira 1048 (A. D. 1638) in the royal capital of Lahore,
from <span class="person">Mulla Adel</span>, of Kashghar, that he (the
Mulla) has read in the revered book of his faith, and
also the <span class="person">lord Mawlána Abd al rahmen Jámî</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_518" id="fnanchor_518"></a><a href="#footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></span>
has stated,
<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pageno">335</span>
in his noble verses, that by the right faith it is necessary
to believe in our heart, and to confess with our
tongue, that the author of existence is independant,
absolute, and without wants; and that his being is
free of matter and without a form, and that he is
better than whatever can be imagined; he existed
primitively whilst the beings were in the mansions
of nothingness; after which, as an object everlasting,
he remained firm, and no other being but he is
always, and one; but his greatness, his attributes,
and his names are without measure and number,
although in a thousand parts he is but one; in these
however he is not confined; the qualities of his majesty
are not perceived by the eye; and no being but
he has life inherent in his qualities; but he lives neither
by his spirit, nor breath, nor body, although he
be living by himself. He is another universe, endowed
with such a knowledge that the world has no
superiority over him, and his omniscience comprehends
the totalities and the parts, the inhabitants and
the places, and the town of existence, in such a manner
that not a grain of sand is without his knowledge;
he is the author of every thing by his will, and
<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pageno">336</span>
the actions of all things may be voluntary, such as
the doings of mankind; or natural, such as the inclination
of a stone, and are all produced by his will.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“Not a thorn pricks without his will;</div>
 <div class="i0">Not a thread is broken without his direction.”</div>
</div>

<p>He is strong, and possesses a perfect power;
without the help of instruments he performs every
thing; from nothingness he brings forth beings; he
hears without an ear; he sees without an eye:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“He hears the petition from afar and near:</div>
 <div class="i0">He sees, be there light or darkness.”</div>
</div>

<p>He speaks, but his speech comes not from his
throat, nor from the tongue and the palate; but
what he announces or withholds is nothing more
than his speech; and his silence is eloquence.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“When God, the Almighty, without words and letters</div>
 <div class="i0">Spoke to nothingness sublime mysteries,</div>
 <div class="i0">Nothingness was moved by delight at these speeches,</div>
 <div class="i0">Dancing through the area of existence.”</div>
</div>

<p>The emergencies of the world, good or bad, are
all from his disposition; and the actions pleasing
or repulsive, are all his creation.</p>

<span class="sc">An account of the Angels.</span></p>

<p>The angels are neither females nor males, and are
pure of all depravity and sins. Some of the first
rank among them are entranced in the contemplation
of the divine perfection which they witness, so
that they are not aware of God Almighty having
created the world and mankind. The second order
of angels are the ministers of bodies and gigantic
forms; the revolution of the heavens is their office;
and with every drop of rain an angel comes down,
and no leaf appears without an angel fostering it.
But among the angels four are distinguished, namely:
<span class="title">Jabrîl</span>, <span class="title">Isráfîl</span>, <span class="title">Mâîkáíl</span>, and <span class="title">Azráîl</span>. The message of
revelation is the business of Jabrîl; to sound the
trumpet belongs to Isráfîl; the surety of professions
is Mâikáil’s; and Azráil seizes the souls. Four
angels are the appointed guardians of mankind, and
write down the good and the bad; two of them are
occupied with this business during the day, and two
during the night. The writers of the good keep the
right side, those of the bad the left. The angels
can in some form appear to men;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i2">“Especially to the eyes of the guides of the ways,</div>
 <div class="i0">From among the possessors of constancy,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_519" id="fnanchor_519"></a><a href="#footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></span>
the prophets and apostles.”</div>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pageno">338</span>
The prophets are the select of God from among all
the children of Adam and of the exalted angels, and
the spirit of Satan can never hurt them, if, by an
extraordinary emergency, one of them commits a
fault, it is reckoned to be for giving good advice.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“Adam, at the moment when he tasted wheat,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_520" id="fnanchor_520"></a><a href="#footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></span></div>

 <div class="i0">From the grain which he ate sprang up a tree;</div>
 <div class="i0">Life in me and in thee is its fruit.”</div>
</div>

<p>Although there be among the prophets, as compared
with each other, a higher and a lower rank in
their exaltation, yet Muhammed the Arabian (may
the blessing of God, the high and omnipotent, be
upon him!) is the noble and excelling prophet, who
unites all virtues and perfections.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“Before the intelligent, there is no messenger</div>
 <div class="i0">But Muhammed for all mankind.”</div>
</div>

<p>He is the seal of God’s prophets, and after him no
other shall come, and when at the end of time the
Messiah shall descend, he shall adopt the law of
Muhammed; he shall convoke the nations to his
religion; the law of the prophet shall cancel all
other laws.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“If the decision of the law of the sovereign (Muhammed) happens to be</div>
 <div class="i2">Corresponding with another law,</div>
<a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pageno">339</span>
 <div class="i2">There is no obedience whatever due to the latter,</div>
 <div class="i0">Except from the circumstance of its being right according to the law of the prophet.”</div>
</div>

<p>The ascent of the prophet<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_521" id="fnanchor_521"></a><a href="#footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></span>
with his body happened
during his being awake, as far as the mosque
<span class="place">Aksa</span>; there he mounted on the back of <span class="title">Borák</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_522" id="fnanchor_522"></a><a href="#footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></span>
and
passed above the heavens. He saw all the prophets,
and the stories of the heavens and the hells; in the
heavenly mansion of Jabrîl (God be praised!) the
angel remained behind him; then, by means of the
arch he proceeded further.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i2">“There was no confident but God;</div>
 <div class="i0">He saw what was to be seen, he heard what was to be heard;</div>
<a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a><span class="pageno">340</span>
 <div class="i0">From thence he turned his face towards his dwelling;</div>
 <div class="i0">His place of repose had not yet become cold.”</div>
</div>

<p>If this supernatural event was associated with the
claim of prophecy, so was it a miracle, and if not,
so was it divine favour; in the existence of the
Lord prophet (the blessing and peace of God be with
him) was a great number of miracles attesting his
mission to the nations, and such ones as are not to
be found with other prophets. There are many
books attributed to God Almighty, and in their
whole number one hundred and four are approved;
but they are not confined to this number, and some
of those which are known, are not praised.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i4">“Every book which God has sent,</div>
 <div class="i0">Is received by the believing as revealing God’s perfection.</div>
 <div class="i0">Such is the <dfn>Tawrit</dfn> (the Old Testament) this book of the Merciful,</div>
 <div class="i0">Which by tradition and writing came to Ibrahim.</div>
 <div class="i2">Another is the Gospel, which came down</div>

</div>

<p>As the book of God contains divine words, it is
ancient, and the letters and sounds are new; the
novelty of an old meaning is like a dress.</p>

<p>The Muhammedan religion is among the most
excellent and most noble religions, and the father of
this religion, the prophet of Arabia, is the best and
the most eminent among the saints of the religions;
there is a number of prophets, particularly the
friends and the posterity of the prophet, but none
is higher than he, the prophet.</p>

<p>When any body is placed in the tomb, then two
angels of a frightful appearance ask him: “Who
was thy God, thy prophet, what thy creed?” If
he give a right answer, then they keep his grave
open, and make a window from heaven to it, that
he may behold his future dwelling. But if his
answer does not prove satisfactory, they beat his
face soft with a club, and close the grave so tight
upon him, that a noise issues from the compression
of his sides; they also open a window from hell to
him, so that he may there see his fate and his habitation.
When the period of the world shall be terminated,
the name of God shall not be pronounced
by any tongue; then, by God’s orders, shall Israfíl
sound the trumpet, and extinguish all like lamps;
afterwards, during ages, there shall be no motion
upon the face of the earth, until Israfíl shall again,
at God’s order, by a blast of the trumpet blow the
<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pageno">343</span>
souls into the dispersed parts of their bodies, so that
all shall revive. Afterwards, at the last judgment,
the angels shall place the journal of actions recorded
at the right hand of the virtuous, and at the left
of the iniquitous. If the balance is weighed down
by the good actions of a person, he goes to heaven;
but if the scale, heavy with sins weighs down the
other, hell awaits the sinner. This being brought
to a close, an invisible bridge is thrown over hell;
this bridge is sharper than the edge of a sword and
thinner than a hair, and the believers and unbelievers
are to be driven over it.</p>

There are
eight gradations, or steps, in heaven; and every
man, according to his knowledge and conduct, shares
a place in them, and enjoys eternal beatitude. The
highest of blessings is the sight of God, the Almighty,
whom the good behold as the moon of fourteen
nights. This is upon the authority of the lord
Mulána Abd-ul rahmen Jami.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_527" id="fnanchor_527"></a><a href="#footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></span>
It is written in an
esteemed book, that there are in hell eight steps, in
which men are placed according to the estimation of
their sins.</p>

<p>Here is a short account of what I have learned
from the speeches of intelligent men of the right
faith. It is contained in their books that the first
being created was the spirit of Muhammed.</p>

<p class="center small">“The first creature of God was my soul.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">345</span>
To this allusion is made in the words quoted from
the Koran. Then all the spirits of mankind were
brought forth; these, before being united with
bodies, remained four thousand years in the vicinity
of the grace of the most high God:</p>

<p class="center small">“God created the souls four thousand years before the bodies.”</p>

<p>The heavens are understood to be the heavenly
bodies of the sphere which is over our heads, and
this has seven circles; the earth is the cover of the
tortoise which is beneath our feet. There are seven
earths:</p>

<p class="center small">“Who created seven heavens and earths like them.”</p>

<p>In each earth there are creatures, and amcng these
creatures propagating inhabitants. The width of
each earth is five hundred journeys of travel. The
compartments of heaven are round; but in the
middle of the circle is the tent of majesty; and in
each sphere is an order of angels occupied with the
worship and adoration of the divinity; one troop
standing somewhat erect; another multitude inclined
(with their hands on their knees); a number
prostrated, with the forehead touching the ground;
others sitting; some carry the throne of God; and
every angel has a place and a post determined, which
he cannot leave.</p>

<p>From sphere to sphere there is a distance to be
<a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pageno">346</span>
traversed in five hundred years of travelling; in each

and the throne of God<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_528" id="fnanchor_528"></a><a href="#footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></span>
is higher than the seven
spheres.</p>

<p class="center small">“He created the heavens and the earths.”</p>

<p>Above the throne of God is the ninth sphere
(ârsh).</p>

<p class="center small">“He created the heavens and the earths in ten days, and then took
rest upon his throne.”</p>

<p>The throne of God, the seven stories of heaven,
and the seven <dfn>âshîánah</dfn> (nests, houses) of the earth
are firm, and having taken their rest, do not move
in any way, and are absolutely without motion.</p>

<p>All that has been enumerated did not exist in the
beginning; the Almighty God created them without
elementary matter by the action of his wisdom and
absolute power. When the day of resurrection
arrives, he shall fold together the heavens, and
change the earth for another earth, and plunge the
heavenly sphere and the earth into nothing. The
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">347</span>
earth of the resurrection will be like an earth of pure
silver, and in this earth nobody shall have committed
a crime. As the happy Abd ullah says:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the day when the earth shall be changed for another earth,
that is, shall be changed for an earth of white silver, where no
blood shall be shed, and no crimes shall be committed.”</p>

<p>On the day of resurrection, heaven and hell shall
be made ready; the dispersed members shall again
form their body and be reunited; and the soul shall
again take possession of them. Some shall be carried
to heaven, others to hell. The first of mankind
who was created was Adam; he was the father
of men; his body was of earth; Adam was the father
of all bodies, and Muhammed the father of all
spirits.</p>

<p class="center small">“I was a prophet and a man, between water and earth;”</p>

<p class="unindent">and all existence was brought forth according to,

<p>The angels have wings to fly, with which they

<p>This is the greatest part of the creed professed by
the people of Islam. They are divided into many
sects. According to the account of some belonging
<a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pageno">348</span>
to the persuasion of the Sonna and the Jamáât,
the Mulla Muhammed Mâsúm, of Kashghar,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_530" id="fnanchor_530"></a><a href="#footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></span>
was a
learned and virtuous man, and one of those who
followed the doctrine of Hanefí, to whom he attached
himself so much as to choose him for his master.
His origin was from Badkahshán, and his name
Shaikh Hossan; he always studied the Koran, the
traditions, and other books of religion and law, and
regulated his conduct after them; in such way he
passed the day; he kept frequent fasts, never read
poems nor listened to stories, and if any body uttered
before him speeches of worldly people, he
became angry. He was very cautious with the
Shiâhs, and admitted them not to his house. The
author of this book asked him, in Lahore: “What
is the cause of the aversion which you always
show to the Shiâhs.” He replied: “I was originally
a Shiâh, and therefore conformed myself to
that creed. One night I saw in a dream the lord
Imâm Hossen, the son of the lord Alí, the son
of Abí Taleb, and asked him about the real truth
of religion; he enjoined me: ‘Be a Sonni, and
keep away from the inconstant, for they are heretics
and idolators of my person, and then utter
unbecoming words against the heads of religion,
Abubekr, Omar, and Osman, and by such
an illusion they lost the right way: the way of
<a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pageno">349</span>
truth is the doctrine of the Sonnites and the
Jamáât.’”</p>

<p>Here follows what I have learned from the Shaikh
Hossen, as well as from Mulla Aádil. A Shiâh is
no Muselman, and when he brings forth his faith, it
is not right, according to the saying of the prophet:</p>

<p class="center small">“Reviling the two shaikhs is an infidelity without repentance
(remission).”</p>

<p>I heard from Mulla Yâkub Tarfánî, that these
words for restraining the tongue exceed all bounds,
and are an exaggeration in the veneration of the two
Shaikhs (the grace of God be upon them); that yet
repentance (remission) is admitted; he said besides
that it is agreed, reviling is no infidelity.</p>

<p>Shaikh Manśur Máterîdî<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_531" id="fnanchor_531"></a><a href="#footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></span>
became a follower of the
lord Imám Abú Hanífa of Kufa, and <dfn>Hujjet ul islam</dfn>,
“the proof of Islam,” the Imám Muhammed Ghazáli,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_532" id="fnanchor_532"></a><a href="#footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></span>
who was a traveller on the same road with the
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">350</span>
lord Jmám Sháfâyat<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_533" id="fnanchor_533"></a><a href="#footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></span>
(the peace of God be upon
them!) said in their literary compositions, and in
books we read, that the root and the foundation of
the seventy and two branches of religion are six
doctrines, namely: the <span class="title">Tashbíah</span>, <span class="title">Tâtîl</span>, <span class="title">Jaber</span>, <span class="title">Kadr</span>,
<span class="title">Rafs</span>, and <span class="title">Naseb</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_534" id="fnanchor_534"></a><a href="#footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pageno">351</span>
In the <dfn>âmedat ul mâtekad</dfn>, “the pillar of believers,”
composed by <dfn>Shaháb ul hak</dfn>, “flame of truth,” Shaikh
of Islamism and of the Muselmans, <span class="person">Abu abd ulla Faselella</span>,
son of the Imám, the blessed, whom God has
taken in his mercy, and whose sins are forgiven, <dfn>Taj
eddin</dfn>, “the crown of the faith,” <span class="person">Abu Sâid al Hassan</span>,
son of <span class="person">Hassan</span>, son of <span class="person">Yúsef al Súrí</span>, is to be found,
that the <dfn>Tashbîhîan</dfn>, “assimilators,” have attached
to the most high God improper and unsuitable attributes,
inasmuch as they have connected his creation
partly with an elementary principle, and partly with
accidents. The <dfn>Tâtîlîan</dfn>, “the indifferent,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_535" id="fnanchor_535"></a><a href="#footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></span>
have
denied God and his attributes. In the before-mentioned
book we find, the creed of this sect is, that
the world has no Creator, and that it always was
such as it is, and that, except what is surely perceived,
there is no other existence.</p>

<p>We have also heard from Shaikh Hossen, that the
<span class="title">Tât´íl</span> maintain what some philosophers asserted, that
<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pageno">352</span>
God is the cause of things, and that the matter of the
world was always in him. We learned also from
Azîzî, that, according to this sect, God, the Almighty,
when he created the world, attached its destiny
to every thing that appeared, and that now, without
God’s taking any active part in it, every thing
exists or perishes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_536" id="fnanchor_536"></a><a href="#footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>The sect of the <dfn>Jaberiah</dfn>, “the compelled,” having
given up, and denying, freedom of action in men,
attach all their deeds to God.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_537" id="fnanchor_537"></a><a href="#footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a><span class="pageno">353</span>
The <dfn>Kadariah</dfn>, “the powerful,” affect God in
themselves, and reckon themselves the creators of
all their actions.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_538" id="fnanchor_538"></a><a href="#footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>The <dfn>Rafs</dfn>, “heretics,” profess their devotion to
Alí (the peace of God be with him!), and in the exaggeration
of their affection, they make an unbecoming
use of their tongue in reviling the illustrious Abu-bekr,
Omar, and Osman (the peace of God be upon
<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pageno">354</span>
them!); they rebelled, and went so far that, whoever
did not, after the prophet of Arabia, without
hesitation acknowledge the supremacy of Alí (the
grace of God be with him!) and profess his being
the chief of the faith and substitute of the prophet,
was not reckoned by them among the Muselmans.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Nawaséb</dfn>, “enemies,” are devoted to Abu-bekr
and Omar, and having prevailed in this devotion,
they rejected Alí (the mercy of God be upon
him!) and proceeded so far that, whoever did not,
after the great prophet, plainly and decidedly acknowledge
Abubekr and Omar (the grace of God be with
them!) as khalifs of the prophet, and as Imáms,
was by them excluded from the circle of the right
faith.</p>

<p>Each of these six sects was subdivided into twelve,
whence seventy and two sects arose.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_539" id="fnanchor_539"></a><a href="#footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></span>
All are in the
fire <em>of hell</em>, by the precepts of the sayings of the
prophet:</p>

<p class="center small">“My nation is divided into seventy and three sects, who are all in the
fire <em>of hell</em>, except one.”</p>

<p>And those only who are without these seventy and
two sects belong to the people of salvation, because
<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">355</span>
they are of the true religion and upon the right road;
but the true religion is that which is not to be found
among the sects mentioned, and in which those six
religions are not likely not to be, because these six
religions did not exist in the time of the prophet
and in the last will of the apostle. After him innovations
took place, so that it is not unknown, in what
time, and in what place or town, and by whom they
became manifest, and from what cause they originated.
By concordance of the people of Islam, the
right road and the true religion is that which Muhammed
(blessing be upon him!) and after him the
noble companions professed, and this faith is that
of the Sonnites and the Jamáât. This is in substance
the creed of Shaíkh <span class="person">Mansúr</span>, and of <span class="person">Hajet ul
islám Abu Abd’ulla</span>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_540" id="fnanchor_540"></a><a href="#footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></span>
We are informed by the learned
of the Hanefî persuasion, and by Mulla <span class="person">Yakúb Turkhanî</span>,
who was an assistant and companion of Mulla
<span class="person">Adil</span>, that the religion of the Sonnites and the Jamâát
is divided into four branches, which are the four
sides of the city of the law of Muhammed, namely,
the <span class="place">Hanefîah</span>, <span class="place">Málkîah</span>, <span class="place">Sháfâya</span>, <span class="place">Hambalîah</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_541" id="fnanchor_541"></a><a href="#footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></span>
and the
wanderer in these four religions is liberated.</p>

AN ACCOUNT OF THE UMAVIYAH AND YEZIDIAH CONNECTED
WITH THE ALI-ILAHIAN.</p>

<p>In the east of Kohistan is a tract of country known
by the name of <span class="title">Shekúnah</span>, and the lord of it is Malek
Yakúb, who boasts of having issued from the family
of the lord of the believers, Mâaviah Ebn Abi Safîan.
The inhabitants of that country are brave, warlike,
pious, and abstemious. They have many commentaries,
and knowledge of law and religion, and religious
books. They acknowledge the divine mission
of Muhammed (the blessing of God be upon him!)
as well as the office of Imám and the khalifat of Abu-bekr
and Omar, and of the lord of believers Mâaviah,
and they revile Alî for having pretended to a divine
rank. His belief was that they ought to possess all
kinds of grain;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_542" id="fnanchor_542"></a><a href="#footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></span>
his followers worshipped him as
divine; this he insinuated to them by this prayer,
which he pronounced himself in the sermons, related
as his saying:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I am God; I am the merciful; I am the bountiful; I am the high;
I am the creator; I am the provider of the necessaries of life; I am
the most compassionate; I am the most propitious; I am he who
bestows a form to the drop of the sperm in the wombs.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_543" id="fnanchor_543"></a><a href="#footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">357</span>
and the like; these words are of Pharâún and Nimrod,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_544" id="fnanchor_544"></a><a href="#footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></span>
and like these are many of their sayings. They
are besides fond of bloodshed, and cruel. They
say improper things about the prophet, as of one
who did not always behave with decency. So it
happened once, that eating dates in company with
other persons, the prophet threw the stones of the
dates towards Alí, and then said: “O Alí! thou hast
eaten a great many dates, because all the stones
are before thee;” Ali answered, “Thou hast
swallowed them with the stones;” and they say
this passage is in the sacred book:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“There are men whose speeches about the present life will astonish
thee, and who will take God for witness of what is in their heart,
whilst they are the most quarrelsome of adversaries.”</p>

<p>And they are approving Ebn Maljám,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_545" id="fnanchor_545"></a><a href="#footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></span>
and say
Maljám is among them:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">358</span>
“There are some men who rescue their soul, desiring in this manner
to perform the will of God.”</p>

<p>They assert that the two Hasáîn are not of the family
of the prophet, according to this verse of the Koran:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Muhammed is not any thing else but one of us; he is yet the
prophet of God, and the seal of the Apostles.”</p>

<p>They say that Yazîd killed Hasan, the son of Alí,
in his house, and did not bring him forth from the
corner where he was concealed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_546" id="fnanchor_546"></a><a href="#footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></span>
He was come for
<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pageno">359</span>
subduing the country of Bîrak; on that account he
was put to death. On the tenth day of the Moheram,
they go on horseback upon a wide field which
is before their town; there they make, of earth, an
image of Hosain who was killed; against him they
dash their horses, and think fortunate those who
can say, that they have been riding against the bodies
of the martyrs of Kerbala;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_547" id="fnanchor_547"></a><a href="#footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></span>
this they call a day of
victory, and on this day they make a greater show
of festivity and rejoicing, because the Imám of the
time, that is, Yazîd, was upon the field of victory.
And on Fridays and festivals they revile from their
pulpits the lord Alí and his offspring. Among them
is one sect in particular which act in this manner,
and, with their swords drawn, curse Alí and his
<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">360</span>
sons, and in this way they pass one day: they are
called <dfn>Sîáf</dfn>, “fencers.”</p>

<p>The same say that the prophet and his offspring,
and particularly their prophet, had the power of
recalling to life and putting to death, of creating and
annihilating any being; and that they did whatever
they wished. But this mode of acting was no more
allowable to their successors, such as that of the
prophets to destroy the living, which power they
possessed on account of their having also that of
recalling to life; but it is not one of our attributes to
render lifeless the living, because we have not the
power of restoring them to life; also because the
creatures have not been made on our account; besides,
the prophet took whatever mate he liked,
because the world was his share, whilst it is not
permitted to us to take the woman of another man.
It is however right, making it our profession, to
wage war against the opposers of faith, and to fight
the enemies of religion for the protection of the law.
This people kill no living beings in the country of
Shekúnah. Their usual food is animal juice, such
as honey, butter, and the like; they use no intoxicating
liquors, nor that prepared from the palm-tree,
nor opium.</p>

<p>Among the <span class="title">Maksud chep</span>, who are a more intelligent
people, the author of this book found himself in
the house of one of them. There a man called <span class="title">Hushíar</span>
<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pageno">361</span>
<span class="title">Refik Nikarindah</span>, asked him: “If it were not
permitted to drink intoxicating liquors, how was
it that the former prophets, and some of the khalifs,
the sons of Ommiah,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_548" id="fnanchor_548"></a><a href="#footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></span>
drank wine?” He
answered: “The wine could not overcome their
understanding; with us, it is not so.” Hushiar
said again to the author of this work: “If the khalifs,
after the prophet, possessed the power to
create and to annihilate lives, why did they not
render the heretics dumb?” The answer was:
“A king sent a phial of deadly poison to the Amir
of the believers, Omar (the grace of God be with
him!) that he may give it to an enemy; the khalif
said: ‘I have no greater enemy than my own
spirit,’ and he drank the whole phial, from which
however his sacred body received no harm; now,
the gentle-minded personage, who could drink
poison, how would he not hear the abuse of mistaken
<a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pageno">362</span>
men? So represent to thyself the other
khalifs.” The <span class="title">Cheps</span> are a tribe of the people of
Shekunah.</p>

 Sheheristâni is the surname of <span class="person">Al Fath Mohammed Ben Abdalkerim</span>,
one of the most celebrated doctors of the Ashârian sect, an account of
which is to follow. He died in the year of the Hejira 548 (A. D. 1153).
He composed several works upon metaphysics and the scholastic theology
of the Muselmans, and among others that which is entitled <span class="title">Nehajat
alekdam fi êlm al Kelam</span>, and on account of which he is entitled <span class="title">Mâtakellam
al-Ashari</span>, “the scholastic of the Ashârian.” We have also from
him a book called <span class="title">Al Melal u alnahal</span>, “the means of curing wearisomeness
and melancholy.”&mdash;(Herbelot.)</p>

 According to Sheheristani, quoted by Pococke (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 211, 1st <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr>), the
Magians were divided into seventy sects; the Jews into seventy-one;
the Christians into seventy-two; and the Moslem into seventy-three.
Among the sects there was always one to be saved.</p>

<p class="footnote">The baron de Hammer says (Journ. As., juin 1825, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 321, Tableau
généalogique des soixante-treize sectes de Islam): “The best information
which we have yet upon the sects and the heresies of Islam are
those given by Pococke, Marraccius, and Sale, according to Sheheristânî,
and the Commentary of Mewakif. Pococke (Specimen historiæ Arabum,
Oxoniæ, 1650, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 194 and 210), Marraccius (Prodromus), and
Sale (Engl. <abbr title="translation">transl.</abbr> of the Koran) trace the principal classes of the
genealogical table of the heresies; but their catalogue is not quite
exact, and still less complete. This subject, interesting for the history
of religions, and above all for that of the Islamitic heresies, is treated
fundamentally in the Commentary of the great scholar Jorjani upon
the <span class="title">Mewakif</span>, that is to say, the metaphysics of Adhad eddin al Ijí, a
valuable work in more than one respect, which work was printed in
Constantinople” (in folio, of 635 pages, in the year of the Hejirah 1039,
A. D. 1824). The baron de Hammer treated this subject summarily in the
number of the journal quoted, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 321-335, and in the subsequent number
for July, 1825, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 32-46.</p>

 The points of faith in dispute among the schoolmen are reducible to
four general heads, called the four bases or great fundamental articles.
The first relates to the attributes of God, and his unity consistent therewith;
the second regards predestination and the justice thereof; the
third concerns the promises and threats; the fourth treats history and
reason, and also the mission of prophets, and the office of Imâm, or chief
pontiff. About all these heads the Muhammedans are divided into different
sects, which may be classed under two principal sorts: the <dfn>orthodox</dfn>
and the <dfn>heretical</dfn>; the former, by a general name, are called <span class="title">Sonnites</span>,
or “Traditionists:” the latter <span class="title">Shiâts</span> (see note, <abbr title="volume One page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 101).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_501" id="footnote_501"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_501"><span class="muchsmaller">[501]</span></a>
 Jamaât signifies properly the <dfn>assembly</dfn>, or as we may say, the <dfn>church</dfn>
of Muselmans. This name is assumed by the Ashârian, who, as Sheheristâni
contends (see Pococke, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 211), were the sect whom the prophet indicated
as selected for salvation.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_502" id="footnote_502"></a>

 The Sonnites, just mentioned, are divided into four sects, the founders
of which I shall mention, in the order as they occur, in the text of
the Dabistán.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_503"><span class="muchsmaller">[503]</span></a>
 The Sifátiah are one of the orthodox sects; they maintain the existence
of the eternal attributes of God, and are on this account named
<dfn>Sifátiah</dfn>, or “Attributists.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_504" id="footnote_504"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_504"><span class="muchsmaller">[504]</span></a>
 The <dfn>Mâtazalah</dfn>, or “Separatists,” were the followers of <span class="person">Wasel Ebn
Ata</span>. He was the disciple of Hassan al Baśri, of whom hereafter. When
he separated from his master, the latter exclaimed: <cite>Kad êttazal amma
Wassel</cite>, “Wassel separates from us:” hence is derived the name of his
followers, <span class="title">Mâtazalah</span>&mdash;(See Herbelot). They entirely rejected all eternal
attributes of God, saying that eternity is the proper or formal attribute
of his essence; that God knows by his <em>essence</em>, and not by his <em>knowledge</em>,
and the same they affirmed of his other attributes, and hence this sect
were also named <span class="title">Mâtalah</span>, or <span class="title">Mâtalites</span>, from their <em>divesting</em> God of his
attributes, in which they place the unity of God. They denied also all
vision of God in paradise by the corporeal eye, and rejected all comparison
or similitude applied to God. They established further, that the word
of God is created; that God is necessarily holden to the observation of
justice in his decrees, to the rewarding of good and the punishment of
the wicked. Moreover they refuted the dogma of absolute predestination,
maintaining that God was not the author of evil, but of good only,
and that man was a free agent: on which account they are also called
<dfn>Kadarian</dfn>, from <dfn>kadr</dfn>, “destiny.” They are subdivided into twenty
sects, taxing each other with infidelity&mdash;(See <cite>Sale’s Koran</cite>, <abbr title="volume One Preliminary">vol. I. Prelim.</abbr>

Eben al-Kossai, quoted by Pocock, <dfn>Al Kalem</dfn> is a science by which disquisitions
are made about the essence and attributes of God, and the
condition of possible things, about creation and restitution, pursuant to
the canons of Islamism. Others define it the science of legal principles
which belong to the articles of faith, and are acquired by positive demonstrations.
Further, conformably with the author of <dfn>Al Mawakef</dfn>, “stations,
or rather theses of metaphysics,” who himself composed a system
of this science, it is a doctrine by which one is rendered capable of confirming
by demonstrations the articles of religion, and of solving doubts.</p>

 <span class="person">Mâlik Ebn Ans</span> (see Sale’s Koran, <abbr title="volume One page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 206), was born at Medina,
according to different accounts, in the years of the Hejira 90, 93, 94 or
95 (A. D. 708, 711, 712, or 713), and died there in the years of the Hejira
177, 178, or 179 (A. D. 793, 794, or 795). This doctor and head of his
sect, is said to have paid great regard to the traditions of Muhammed.
He was distinguished by the humble confession of his ignorance. Being
asked his opinion as to forty-eight questions, his answer to thirty-two of
them was, that he did not know.</p>

some, or according to others in Baghdad, where he died in the year of the
Hejira 241 (A. D. 855). He could repeat no less than a million of
Muhammed’s traditions. Refusing to acknowledge the Koran to be
created, he was, by order of the Khalif Al Mótasem, severely scourged and
imprisoned.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="person">Ahmed Hanbal</span> was the contemporary and friend of <span class="person">Muhammed Ebn

in Palestine, and died in the year of the Hejira 204 (A. D. 819-20), in

sects of the Sonnites, distinguished by the title of “<span class="title">the followers of reason</span>,”

were, that they allowed the attributes of God to be distinct from
his essence, yet so as to forbid any comparison being made between God
and his creatures. They further assert, after their master, that all the
actions of men are subject to the power of God, being created by him,
and that the power of man has no influence at all on that which he is
empowered to do, but that, both the power and what is subject thereto,
fall under the power of God. Manifold are the subtle distinctions in this
abstruse subject; those who appear the least obscure, use this form:
There is neither compulsion nor free liberty, but the way lies between
the two; the power and will in man being both created by God, though
the merit or guilt be imputed to man. Yet, after all, it is judged the
safest way to follow the steps of the primitive Moslems, and, avoiding

this matter wholly unto God.&mdash;(See Sale’s <cite>Koran</cite>, <abbr title="volume One pages">vol. I. pp.</abbr> 219-225.)

self-subsisting being</em>, which with them is the definition of a body: but
yet some of them affirmed him to be finite and circumscribed, and others
allowed that he might be felt by the hand or seen by the eye.</p>

 Muhammed, in the fifty-second year of his age and the twelfth of his
preaching (A. D. 621), whilst lying asleep between the mountains Al Safa
and Merva, in the vicinity of Mecca, had a vision in which he proceeded
from earth through the seven heavens to the throne of God. Muhammed
himself alludes to it twice in the Koran, the seventeenth chapter of which
is entitled “the night journey;” but he mentions nothing else but a
vision: it was the fanaticism of his followers which wrought the most
strange circumstances into an absurd fable, according to which their
prophet was visited by the angel Gabriel, and in his company carried first
from Mecca to Jerusalem, and then, upon a ladder of light, to the presence
of God.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_537"><span class="muchsmaller">[537]</span></a>
 There are three principal opinions about the decrees of God, and the
power of man with regard to his actions, among the Muhammedans.</p>

<p class="footnote">The first is that of the <dfn>Motazalahs</dfn>, according to which man is the
agent in good and evil, in faith, and infidelity, in obedience and rebellion;
all his actions are his; for it could not be said to man, “Act,” if
he had not the faculty of acting. Evil and iniquity can by no means be
attributed to God; an infidel is composed of a man and of infidelity: God
created the first, but not the latter.</p>

<p class="footnote">The second opinion is that of the <dfn>rigid Jabariahs</dfn>, followers of <span class="person">Jahmi
Ebn Sefwan</span>, whose sect flourished about the middle of the eighth century.
According to them there is no action but in God; man acts, without
power his own, without will or choice, exactly as a tree produces
fruits, as water runs, as a stone moves. Reward and punishment are
likewise proceeding from necessity, as well as the imposition of orders
comes from necessity.</p>

<p class="footnote">The third opinion is that of the <dfn>moderate Jabariahs</dfn>, and also that of
the Asharian, who maintain that God creates the actions of man, good as
well as bad, but that man <em>acquires</em> them: that is to say, God creates the
power by, under, and with, which man acts, but man wills the action,
and prepares himself to it, which is called <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">كسب</span> <dfn>kasb</dfn>, “acquisition;”
an action therefore, with respect to creation, belongs to God, but with
respect to production, by which it is manifested, that is, by “acquisition,”
it depends upon man, and falls under his power. Abul Hasan
of Isfahan says, that what makes an impression upon a fact, are the power
of God and the power of man <em>jointly</em>. When man applies his mind to
obedience, God creates in him the action of obedience, and when he
applies his mind to transgression, God creates in him the action of transgression;
and in that respect it is man who brings into existence or produces
his action, although in reality he be not the producer.&mdash;(See on

 The <span class="title">Kadariahs</span> or <span class="title">Kadarian</span> belong to the Motazalah (Abul Faraj,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 20). The Kadarian have been compared to the Magians, inasmuch as
they acknowledge two principles, light and darkness, or good and evil;
the first of which they ascribe to God, the other to man and to the devil;
nevertheless, every thing belongs to God, as created by his will; that is,
with respect to creation; but the actions belong to the actors.&mdash;(<cite>Pocock</cite>,

 We have already seen, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_323">323</a>, that Muhammed has predicted the
division of his followers into seventy-three sects (and not seventy-two,
as above). Why seventy-three? It was (see <cite>Pocock</cite>) to make
Muhammedism have one sect more than Christianism, which had seventy-two,
counting one more than Judaism, which, to have seventy-one, had
added one to the seventy sects of Magism.</p>

 The meaning of this passage appears to me to be that Alí wished the
Muselmans to apply to agriculture, which the Arabs generally despise or
neglect.</p>

 According to the most probable account of historians, it never was
Alí who pretended to be a God, but <span class="person">Abdallah</span>, son of <span class="person">Wahab</span>, son of <span class="person">Saba</span>,
a Jew converted to Islamism, who was the first instigator of the seditious
movements to which Omar fell a victim, promulgated the doctrine, that a
particle of divinity resided in Alí, the true Imám, that he is not dead,
but only for a time withdrawn from the eyes of men; that he would
reappear one day upon the earth, and fill it with justice, in the same manner
as it is now filled with iniquities. This doctrine served as a foundation
to the different sects which admitted the transmission of the Imamate
to the descendants of Alí, by right of succession, and spread in the
east and west of Asia, in Africa, and in Spain.</p>

 Nimrod and Pharáun maintain, in the Koran and in the traditions of
the Muhammedans, the same character as in the Bible of the Hebrews,
for tyranny against men and presumption towards God; the first was the
enemy of Abraham, the other of Moses: both were punished by God.</p>

 We have already (see <abbr title="volume One page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 100, note) touched upon the enmity
which existed between the family of Alí and that of Moaviah, the son of
Abu Sofian and of Hinda, a woman famous for her animosity against
Muhammed, the prophet. Nevertheless Moaviah became one of the secretaries
of Muhammed, after whose death he was appointed to the government
of Syria by Omar, and confirmed in that station by Osman. After
the violent death of this khalif, Moaviah declared himself the avenger of
his protector, and would not submit to Alí, upon whom he waged war
during four years, and after whose death he opposed with equal ardour
Hasan, who succeeded his father in the khalifat. Surrounded by
rebellion in his own camp, Hasan could not resist, but resigned his
right and person to Moaviah. He died in Medina of poison given him,
as some say, by his wife, Jáda, or by his minister, at the injunction of
Moaviah (see <cite>Elmacin, <abbr title="translation">trad.</abbr> Erpenii</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 56); according to others, in
concordance with the Dabistán, by the fraud of Moaviah’s son, Yazid,
who seduced Jáda, and instigated her to poison her husband, promising
to marry her, but after the perpetration of the act, rejected, with
scorn, the woman supplicating for the price of her deed. I shall add,
according to <cite>Abulfeda</cite> (<cite><abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr> of Reiske</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 350), that in Hasan terminated
(A. D. 661) the legitimate khalifat, or the succession of chiefs
whom the free consent of the Muslims called and established, and thus
was fulfilled the prediction of the prophet, which from the mouth of
Safina, his freeman, is recorded in the traditions as follows: “Thirty
years after his decease shall last the true and legitimate khalifat, and
then be succeeded by tyranny.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_547" id="footnote_547"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_547"><span class="muchsmaller">[547]</span></a>
 After Moaviah’s death, A. D. 679, Yazid, his son, assumed the khalifat,
but Hosain, another son of Alí, still lived, and was invited by the
inhabitants of Kufa to their town for receiving their oath of allegiance.
Yielding to their invitation, he set out from Mecca, where he had concealed
himself, with thirty-two horsemen and forty men on foot. Not
far from Kerbela, in an arid tract of country in Jrak Arabi, he was
encountered by five or ten thousand men, sent by Yazid to destroy him.
The son of Alí bravely fought this superior force during one-half of the
day, but at last fell, with four of his brothers, as many of his own sons,
and all his surrounding friends, seventy-two in number. The survivors,
his women, were conducted to Damascus, where Hosain’s head, severed
from his body, rejoiced the savage eyes of Yazid, now fixed in the khalifat.
Hosain’s relics (as mentioned <abbr title="volume One page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 48) lie buried at Kerbela.
The anniversary of his death, the 30th September, A. D. 680, is still
celebrated by the Shiâhs, with every imaginable demonstration of grief
about the fate of Alí’s posterity, and of execration of their oppressors.</p>

 Ommiah, according to Herbelot (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub voce</i>) is the name of a respectable
personage among the Arabians, who was the son of <span class="person">Abd-ul-shems</span>,
and whose posterity bears the title of <dfn>benu Ommiah</dfn>, “the
children of Ommiah.” But their celebrity begins with the before mentioned
Moaviah; he was the first of fourteen khalifs of this family, who
reigned in succession ninety-one years. The last of them was <span class="person">Mervan
Muhammed ben Mervan, ben Hakem</span>, and after him there remained of
this family but <span class="person">Abd-ur-rahmen</span>, who escaped from the hands of the
Abbasides, and later (in 756 A. D.) established the dynasty of the Ommiades
in Spain, where fifteen of them held successively the government
during nearly two hundred years, until 986 A. D., when the Alides seized
the sovereignty of that country.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section ii: an account of the second sect of the
people of Islam, which sect is known under the
name of Shíahs.</span>&mdash;The author of this book was informed,
by the learned of this sect, that they agreed
to attribute the office of Imám and the khalifat, with
the title of Amir of the believers, in particular to
Alí (the peace of God be with him!) that he was
established by clear tradition, or by manifestation or
by testament; and they maintain that the khalifat
was not alienable from the descendants of his highness,
and if such a transgression happened, it can
have been only by violence and by tyranny; they
also said, that the office of an Imám is not to be
given by the decision of a council, which may depend
upon the choice of the vulgar, so that the Imám
may be appointed by their injunction, but the true
decision is that which derives its origin and support
from the pillars of the faith; and the dignity of the
prophetic asylum, <span class="title">Muhammed</span> (may the benedictions
of God be upon him!) does not deserve that there be
negligence used or carelessness shown in such a matter,
or that it be committed to the multitude. They
argue thus upon the condition necessary for the
<a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pageno">363</span>
appointment of an Imám, upon its establishment
and stability, which requires to be defended by the
inferior and higher people. These are the opinions
in which they agree about opposing or appointing
an Imám, about words or deeds in the state of
religion.</p>

<p>Some however, called <span class="title">Zaydiyat</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_549" id="fnanchor_549"></a><a href="#footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></span>
opposed them in
what was said; and there is among the Shiâhs a
great difference of opinion about the establishment
of the Imám’s office, and at all times, before us until
later days, there was much discoursing about it:
they differ widely about the number of the Imáms.
They are divided in different sects, and we shall
in this book give an account of what we have seen
of them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center small"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span class="pageno">364</span>
OF THE TWELVE SECTS OF THE SHIAHS.</p>

<p>The author of this book relates what he has learned
from Mulla Muhammed Mâsúm, from Muhammed
Múmin, and from Mulla Ibrahim, who in the year of
the Hejira 1053 (A. D. 1643) were in Lahore, and
from others. The Mulla Ibrahim had great faith
in his religion, and had a great aversion to the followers
of the Sonna and the Jamaât, whom he never
approached at meals; he did not during six months
taste any butter in Lahore, because it happened to
be a Hindu or Sonnite who was selling it. He said:
“In the beginning of my manhood, I once slept in
a field, and saw in a dream a great host of luminous
beings, who said to me: ‘Be a Muselman.’
I answered: ‘Such is my inclination.’ They said
again: ‘Take care of not being a Sonnite;’ and
they added much about this subject to dissuade
me from it. When they had disappeared, I asked
their followers: ‘Who were they?’ They replied:
‘Imáms.’ When I awoke, from that moment
I never associated with the Sonnites.”</p>

<p>With this sect there is but one Lord God, and no
other: he is one, living, omniscient, self-acting,
almighty, hearing and seeing every thing, and the
first of speakers; they acknowledge his power, not
only over possible, but even impossible things;
they consider God Almighty as possessed of qualities
<a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">365</span>
necessarily inherent in his essence; they hold
the servant of God to be master of his own actions.
With them the word of God is not ancient, but it is
a novelty, because its meaning is understood from
sounds. They adduce the words of <span class="person">Abu Jâfr Túsî</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_550" id="fnanchor_550"></a><a href="#footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></span>
(the mercy of God be with him!), who says that, fundamentally
considered, the seventy and three sects
are only two religions, namely: <dfn>Navá seb</dfn>, “the enemies
of Alí,” and <dfn>Ravafés</dfn>, “heretics” (the Shiâhs),
because on the day on which Muhammed (the peace
of God be upon him!) left the <em>mortal</em> garment, there
were forty thousand companions present, who all
acknowledged, with approbation and satisfaction,
Abubekr as khalif, except eighteen persons, who
were attached to Alí (the peace of God be with him!)
who were joined by seventeen other individuals,
who, averse to Abubekr, did not acknowledge him,
nor give their consent to his khalifat. He said of
these seventeen, <dfn>rafas á na</dfn>, “they abandoned me,”
or “they separated from me,” whence they received
<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">366</span>
the name <dfn>raváfés</dfn>, “schismatics;” and those eighteen
persons said to the companions:</p>

<p class="center small">“You have appointed Abubekr without inauguration.”</p>

<p class="unindent">that is: “You raised to the khalifat Abubekr, without
having due sanction for it;” on which account
they received the title of <dfn>Naváséb</dfn>, “enemies,” and
each of these two sects had two names; the one
their own, on account of the part which they took
in the appointment of the khalif, and the other name,
which their antagonist or enemy gave them; all the
companions called themselves <dfn>the people of the faith</dfn>,
or <dfn>the people of the Sonnat and Jamáât</dfn>, whilst those
eighteen persons called them <dfn>naváseb</dfn>, “enemies,”
and to themselves they gave the title of <dfn>múmin</dfn>,
“believers,” and <dfn>Shiâhs</dfn>, “troop,” but all the companions
named them <dfn>Ráfés</dfn>, “heretics.” Afterwards,
the religion of the Naváséb divided itself into
fifty and five sects, and that of the Raváfés into
eighteen, as it was said:</p>

<p class="center small">“All are in the fire of hell, except one.”</p>

<p>Of these sects, one only is to belong to the people
of salvation, because they profess the right faith,
and this right faith consists in believing the unity,
the justice of God, the dignity of the prophet and of
the Imám, and the resurrection, and in maintaining
the truth of each of these five articles. As God
Almighty thinks good to choose one among his
<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pageno">367</span>
servants, whom he sends as his prophet and apostle,
that he may announce the right way to his subjects
and creatures, he who is sent must be pure of all our
venial and mortal sins; his word is to be a mediation
between God and man; and the prophet, who
is sent by God, finds it necessary to choose one like
him to fill his place after him, and this substitute
must also be pure of all venial and mortal sins; this
substitute, or khalif, must choose one who may
take his place after him, so that the centre of the
face of the earth may never remain destitute of
Imáms; and that, by the reasoning of wisdom and
by his efforts, the decisions in the law may be preserved
right, and the collection of proofs not lose
its purity among them. Muhammed chose Alí, and
appointed him his executor and khalif, and Alí, after
Muhammed, was the best and wisest of all prophets
of the family; the other Imáms (the blessing of God
be upon them!) were his sons; as the first, so were
the last, and at the end they remained the same as
they had been in the beginning. The number of
Imáms, according to the <dfn>Akhbár Nabi</dfn>, “History of
the Prophets,” was twelve,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_551" id="fnanchor_551"></a><a href="#footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></span>
eleven of them passed
<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">368</span>
to the other world, the twelfth is living for ever; at
last he shall appear, and render the world as full of
virtue as it is now full of injustice and tyranny.</p>

<p>They say, that Abubekr, Omar, and Osman, and
the children of Amîah, and Abasíah, their companions,
usurped the dignity of Imáms, on which account
they revile them. Some of them assert that
Osmán burnt some volumes of the Koran, and threw
away some of the surahs, which were in favor of
Alí and of his descendants; of which the following
is one:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_552" id="fnanchor_552"></a><a href="#footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">In the name of the bountiful and merciful God.</p>

<p class="blockquote">O you who have faith, believe in the two lights, <span class="title">Muhammed</span>
and <span class="title">Ali</span>, whom we have sent, and who recite our verses to
<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
you, and put you on your guard against the chastisement of
the great day. These two lights <em>proceed</em> the one from the
other. As to myself, I understand and I know.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Those who fulfil the order of God and of his prophet, such
as it is given to them in the verses of the Koran, those shall
enjoy the gardens of delight. As to those who, after having
believed, became infidels by transgressing their compact,
and what the prophet had stipulated for them, they shall be
thrown into hell, because they have unjustly treated their
own souls, and have disobeyed the preaching prophet. These
shall be drenched with hot water.</p>

<p class="blockquote">It is God who illuminated the heavens and the earth, as it
was his pleasure; who made his choice among the angels and
prophets; who placed the latter among the number of believers
in the midst of his creatures.&mdash;God does what he
wills: there is but he, the bountiful and merciful God.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Those who preceded them, have already machinated against
their prophets; but I have punished them for their perfidy,
and, certainly, my punishment is violent and severe. God
had already destroyed Ad<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_553" id="fnanchor_553"></a><a href="#footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></span>
and Tamud,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_554" id="fnanchor_554"></a><a href="#footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></span>
on account of their
crimes; he made of them an example for warning you.
Shall you then not fear?</p>

<p class="blockquote">Because Pharaoh acted tyrannically towards Moses and his
brother Aaron, I drowned him in the waters, as well as those
who followed him, in order that it may serve as a sign for you.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">370</span>
Many among you are prevaricators; but God will assemble
them all on the day of resurrection; and they will not be
able to answer when interrogated by him: certainly, hell is
their habitation. God is all-knowing and wise.</p>

<p class="blockquote">O prophet! my advertisement arrived (at its destination);
perhaps will they act (conformably to it). Those who turned
away from my words have already experienced detriment.
Are they comparable to those who accomplish thy ordinances,
and whom I will reward by the gardens of delight? For
God is the Lord of mercy and great rewards.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Ali is of the number of pious; we shall restore him his right
on the day of judgment. We are not ignorant of their intention
to defraud him. We have honored him more than all
thy family. He and his race are of the number of sufferers,
and certainly their enemy is the Imam of sinners.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_555" id="fnanchor_555"></a><a href="#footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Say to those who became infidels after having believed:
“You have sought after the comforts of the present life, and
you have been eager in the pursuit of them; but you have
forgotten what God and his prophet have promised you.
You have broken the engagements which you had taken in a
formal manner; yet we quoted to you examples, in the hope
that you would follow the good direction.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">O prophet, we have sent thee clear verses. Those who
were faithful, and attached themselves to them, will receive
assistance after thee. Turn away from those who turn away
from me. Certainly, he shall make them appear on the day
on which nothing shall avail them, and when they will have no
pity to hope for. Their habitation shall be hell, from which
they shall not be removed.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Celebrate the name of thy lord, and be of the number of
his adorers. We have already sent Moses, and Aaron, and
<a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">371</span>
those who followed them; but they treated Aaron unjustly.
Patience is an excellent virtue. Among them we changed
some into apes<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_556" id="fnanchor_556"></a><a href="#footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></span>
and hogs; we cursed them until the day of
resurrection. Have patience; certainly they shall be punished.</p>

<p class="blockquote">We have gratified thee with an authority equal to that which
was possessed by the messengers who preceded thee, and we
have given thee instructions in their persons. Perhaps mankind
will be converted. He who turns away from my command
shall be soon called away by me <em>from this world</em>. Let
them therefore enjoy some time their impiety. Ask no information
concerning the violators of God’s law.</p>

<p class="blockquote">O prophet, we granted thee the power of loading the neck
of those who believed in the strength of a compact which we
contract. Be thou of the number of the grateful.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Certainly, Ali is pious. He passes the night prostrate
<em>before God</em>. He is cautious with respect to another life, and
he hopes to merit the reward of his Lord. Say, will they be
treated in the same manner, they who have acted unjustly,
although they knew the chastisement which I prepare for
them? Chains shall be put on their necks, and they shall
repent of their acts.</p>

<p class="blockquote">We have announced to thee a progeny of just men,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_557" id="fnanchor_557"></a><a href="#footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></span>
who
will not oppose my commands. My bounty and mercy are
upon them, living or dead,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_558" id="fnanchor_558"></a><a href="#footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></span>
until the day of resurrection.
My anger is against those who act tyrannically towards thy posterity;
wicked men who shall suffer the pain <em>which they deserve</em>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">As to those who walked upon the road of thy posterity, my
mercy is granted to them, and they shall be safe in the
kiosques <em>of paradise</em>. Glory to God, King of the creatures.</p>

THE RELIGION OF THE AKHBÁRIN.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_559" id="fnanchor_559"></a><a href="#footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></span></p>

<p>Mulla Muhammed Amîn, of Asterabád,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_560" id="fnanchor_560"></a><a href="#footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></span>
gave currency
in this time to this religion: they say, after
having acquired the natural and revealed sciences,
he made a pilgrimage to the temple of Mecca, and
after having critically examined the sacred sayings,
he adhered to what he thought the right sense, and
composed the work <span class="title">Fava-íd Madaníy</span>, “Useful Notes,
by a Citizen of Medina.” In the book <span class="title">Danish
nameh, Káteb Sháhî</span>, which was written for the use of
Dáráí Sekander Dostgáh Muhammed Kalí Kateb
Shah, it is stated, that the exalted wish and furthermost
intent is the knowledge of what is particular
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pageno">373</span>
to the origin and end, and the explanation of this
meaning is contained in the verse of the merciful:</p>

<p class="center small">“The faith in God, and in the day of eternal life.”</p>

<p>And the tradition of the noble Amír of the believers
and the adored Imám (the blessing of God
and peace be upon them and upon their holy descendants):</p>

<p class="center small">“God take compassion upon the man of whom I know from whence he
came, where he is, and whither he goes,”</p>

<p class="unindent">entered into this meaning. The learned, in the
maintenance of this station, divided into several
sects. The one sect established this station by investigation
and evidence; then a division of this sect
rendered it obligatory not to say any thing contrary
to the possessors of revelation, and these are called
<dfn>Matkalmin</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_561" id="fnanchor_561"></a><a href="#footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></span>
“scholastics,” for the reason that they
have composed the science of scholastic theology,
on account of rational considerations, and have
enlarged argumentation in the science of scholastic
dialectics and theological questions.</p>

<p>Another sect did not bind themselves in their
reasoning; they are called <dfn>Hukmá másháyîn</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_562" id="fnanchor_562"></a><a href="#footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></span>
“the
<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pageno">374</span>
walking philosophers,” because their first founders
followed the stirrup of <span class="person">Arastu</span> (Aristotle),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_563" id="fnanchor_563"></a><a href="#footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></span>
and at the
time when Arastu, as Vizir of <span class="person">Iskander</span> (Alexander)
was walking to and from the palace of this king;
they took the opportunity of being instructed in science
by this philosopher.</p>

<p>Another sect adopted this doctrine with pious austerities.
Afterwards, a division of this sect made an
application of this doctrine as necessary to the Koran,
and took care not to maintain any thing contrary to
the companions of the revelation, and these are
called <dfn>Sofis matsherâîn</dfn>, “orthodox Sofis.” Another
sect did not believe this necessary, and these are
entitled <span class="title">Hukmá âshrákîn</span>, to whom <span class="person">Aflátún</span> (Plato)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_564" id="fnanchor_564"></a><a href="#footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></span>
who was the preceptor of Arastú, furnished lessons
and instructions of piety.</p>

<p>Another class adopted this doctrine with a view
<a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">375</span>
to the precepts of the possessors of holiness, and
made it a necessary condition that in all questions
about customs, in which reason is <em>likely</em> to err, they
should strictly adhere to the sayings of the possessors
of holiness; and these are called <span class="title">Akhbárîn</span>.
The companions of the pure Imáms (the blessing
and peace of God be upon them!) all observed this
rule, and the Imáms (peace be upon them!) prohibited
them the science of scholastic theology, and the
science of the fundamentals of religion and law,
which have been collected according to the views of
the intelligent; and likewise they prohibited the
science of jurisprudence, which has been composed
as an abstract of opinions, for this reason: because,
safe from error, one is inclosed in what is right by
the words of the possessors of holiness, and because
many contradictions and discordancies occur in the
three sciences.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_565" id="fnanchor_565"></a><a href="#footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></span>
As it is evident and clear that there
<a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pageno">376</span>
are no contradictions in truth, so certainly one of
the different opinions is false. The Imáms also
instructed their companions in the science of scholastic
dialectics, in the science of the fundam&nbsp;etals
of religion and of law, and in jurisprudence; but
these three sciences are, in many of the questions,
not without contradiction with the sciences which
the professors of common religion have combined.
The lords of the temple (peace be upon them!) have
declared, “that in the three sciences, as received
by the generality of the people, truth is that which
from us is come to them, and error is whatever
<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">377</span>
originate from their conceptions.” The doctrine
of the <span class="title">Akhbárîn</span>, in after times called <dfn>Gháibet
sâry</dfn>, “the minor absence,” which by some is
reckoned among the traditions of the seventy-and-three,
and by others among the traditions of the
seventy four sects, became diffused among the
learned of the <span class="title">Imámíyat</span>; although it was also known
among the first of the <dfn>Ghâibet</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_566" id="fnanchor_566"></a><a href="#footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></span>
<dfn>Kaberî</dfn>, “the great
absence,” and the companions of the Imáms
(peace be upon them!) after having received the
three sciences from the people of the temple (blessing
be upon them!), formed a collection of them in
a book according to their direction; it was to this
that the people of the temple referred in their belief
and actions, until the time of the Ghâibet Kaberî of
the Shíahs, and this book, by way of continuation,
was brought down to the times of the moderns; the
entire work, which was compiled by the trusty friend
of the right faith, <span class="person">Muhammed ben Yâkúb al Kalbiy</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_567" id="fnanchor_567"></a><a href="#footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></span>
(may his tomb be sanctified!) comprehends the
three sciences.</p>

<p><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pageno">378</span>
Further, when <span class="person">Muhammed ben Ahmed Aljanáîd</span>, who
was eminent in analogy,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_568" id="fnanchor_568"></a><a href="#footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></span>
and <span class="person">Hassen ben Hassáîn ben
Alí, ben Abí âkîl</span>, a lofty scholastic theologian, appeared,
and were violent jurists; in their time,
the circle of teaching and learning the common religion
being in the colleges and schools, they studied
the book of theology, and the book of the fundamentals
of the common religion; but as they
did not possess all the expertness required for the
science of the fundamentals of religion and for
that of theology, which were derived by tradition
from the Imáms, they adapted to the common religion
some among the subjects of scrutiny in the science
of scholastic theology, and in that of the fundamentals
of theology: and made choice of a doctrine
which was a mixture of the doctrine of the
Akhbárîns and of that of the common religion, and
so laid the foundation of rational dialectics.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_569" id="fnanchor_569"></a><a href="#footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></span>
After
<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pageno">379</span>
them, <dfn>Shaikh Mafíd</dfn>, “the beneficent Shaikh,” (the
mercy of God be with him!) that is, the Shaikh <span class="person">Abú
Jâfr</span>, on account of heedlessness and of the good
opinion of those two eminent men, conformed himself
to them, and he formed, in scholastic theology
and in fundamental jurisprudence, a system of doctrine,
mixing with that of the common religion that
of the Akhbarîn, and that of the <dfn>Aśulîn</dfn>, “solid reasoners;”
on that account, the learned of the Imámíyat
sect divided into <span class="title">Akhbárîn</span> and <span class="title">Asulîn</span>. Likewise
<dfn>Alámah hallî</dfn>, “the most learned ornament,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_570" id="fnanchor_570"></a><a href="#footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></span>
that is, Shaikh <span class="person">Jemál eddin mátaher</span>, has exhausted to
the utmost this subject, in the discussion about prophecy
and unity, and at last the <dfn>sharh movákef</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_571" id="fnanchor_571"></a><a href="#footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></span>
“explanation of the stations” and the origins of the
book of religions and attributes have also been elucidated
by it. When shaikh <dfn>Mafíd, istáz-îlm alihadî</dfn>,
“the teacher of the science of direction,” that is,
<span class="person">Saíd Mírtasí</span>, lived, and was the <dfn>istáz rais al taifah</dfn>,
“chief teacher of the sect,” this religion was diffused
among the learned of the Jmámîyat, until the
time of the most learned of the East and the West, <span class="person">Alámah-hallí</span>;
and as, penetrating into the depth of knowledge,
<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pageno">380</span>
he, <span class="person">Alámah-halli</span>, surpassed in the sciences <span class="person">Ebn
Janaíd</span>, and <span class="person">Ebn abî âkîl</span>, and the shaikh <span class="person">Mafîd</span>; they
gave a greater expansion and currency to the mixt
religion in the book of scholastic and fundamental
theology, and in the controversial dialectics relative
to faith and law, established the mixt religion. As
the <dfn>ahádís</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_572" id="fnanchor_572"></a><a href="#footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></span>
“traditions” of the common religion,
on the subjects of revelation and unity, were not
exempt from adulterations, they published the series
of traditions in their own book, divided into four
parts. And Alámah-hallî (the mercy of God be
with him!) on account of heedless confidence
divided into four parts the traditions of his book,
and the book of the sect of the <dfn>Mahakah</dfn>, “the asserters
of truth,” in such a manner as was also
manifested by the <dfn>Ilm ilahadî</dfn>, “the science of the
direction” (revelation), and the <dfn>ra-is</dfn> (chief) of the
sect, and <dfn>sikat al islám</dfn>, “the trusty friend of the
right faith,” and head of the Shaiks, <dfn>Alsadik</dfn>,
“speaker of truth,” that is, <span class="person">Muhammed Ebn Bábúyah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_573" id="fnanchor_573"></a><a href="#footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></span>
<span class="person">Alkamî</span>; and others: hence the whole tribe <span class="title">Mahakah</span>
<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span class="pageno">381</span>
professed this as true, and, after <span class="person">Alámah-hally</span>, the
shaikh <dfn>Shahîd awl</dfn>, “the first witness,” that is, the
shaikh <span class="person">Muhammed maki</span>, made it the rule of his religion,
and laid the foundation of his literary works
upon it; after them, the <dfn>sultan Almadkakín</dfn>, “the
sultan of the refiners” (acute investigators), shaikh
<span class="person">Alí</span> (the mercy of God be upon him!) conformed
himself to them, and <dfn>Al âalem al rabánî, Shahid-alsánî</dfn>,
“the learned of the world, the doctor of divinity,
the second witness,” that is, the shaikh <dfn>Zin eddin</dfn>
“the ornament of the faith,” <span class="person">Jabel al âamlî</span> (the
mercy of God Almighty be with him!) took also the
rule of this religion. This was until the time arrived
for the learned of the moderns, in the science of <span class="title">Muhammedan</span>
traditions, and the science of biographies
and characters of persons to whom the traditions
were handed down, and the most pious among them,
the master of the whole in the whole, that is, <span class="person">Mirza
Muhammed of Asterabâd</span> (may the light of God illume
his tomb!). <em>He said</em>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_574" id="fnanchor_574"></a><a href="#footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></span>
“At last, as a sequel to this, he
(Jabel) instructed me, a humble individual, in all
the sciences relative to the traditions, and gave me
this injunction: ‘Revive thou the religion of the
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pageno">382</span>
Akhbárîn, and if any doubt arise, that creates an
opposition to this creed, discard that doubt.’
And this doctrine has fixed itself in my mind.
But it was decreed by the Lord of Glory that it
should be manifested through my pen. Afterwards,
having received all the praised sciences
from the greatest of the learned, I, humble individual,
during some years staying in the splendid
town of Medina, bowed my head under the
collar of meditation, and humbled myself at the
door of the temple of the Lord of Glory; I sought
refuge with the spirits of the sacred place of the
companions of prophecy, and I repeated afresh
the sacred sayings, and the book of the common
religion; that is, that of the opposers to the
Imámíyat, and the special book, that is, that of
the Imámíyat; in order to perfect myself in penetration
and meditation; so that, by the favor of
the Lord of Glory, and by the benedictions of the
prince of prophets (Muhammed), and of the pure
Imáms (the blessing and peace of God be upon
them all!) by the direction of him, to whom obedience
is due, I conformed to what was right, and
succeeded in composing the <span class="title">Faváid madaníy</span>, ‘The
Useful Notes, by a Citizen of Medina.’” Subquently,
Muhammed Asterabádí had the honor of
being instructed by the most noble of this sect; afterwards
they approved his composition, and congratulated
<a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a><span class="pageno">383</span>
the author upon it. (The mercy of God
be upon them!)</p>

<p>Among the Imámíahs it is decided that the Imám
<span class="person">Muhammed, son of Hassan Askery</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_575" id="fnanchor_575"></a><a href="#footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></span>
is still alive, but
concealed from view; they divide the time of his
absence into two epochs;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_576" id="fnanchor_576"></a><a href="#footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></span>
namely, “the minor
<a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a><span class="pageno">384</span>
and the greater absence.” The minor absence,
which extends to seventy-three years, falls into
the time of <span class="person">Mâtemed Abásí</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_577" id="fnanchor_577"></a><a href="#footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></span>
in the year of the Hejira
266 (A. D. 879); the greater absence took place in
the time of <span class="person">Rásí</span>, the son of <span class="person">Mukteder Abásî</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_578" id="fnanchor_578"></a><a href="#footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></span>
The
distinction between these two epochs is that,
during the minor absence, there were a registrar
and delegates as intermediates between the pious
persons of the religion and the Imáms, whilst, during
the greater absence, the appointing and establishing
was broken off. The first Vakîl, “delegate,
agent,” was <span class="person">Osman</span>, son of <span class="person">Said ul Umrul Asadi</span>,
in the holy place (of Medina); after him, by command
of the Imám of the time, his son, <span class="person">Abu Jâfer</span>,
took charge of the office, which he held about fifty
<a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pageno">385</span>
years; after him came <span class="person">Abu ’l Kásem Hossain Ebn Rúh
Ebn Ali Baher Nóubakhtí</span>, who bequeathed his place
to <span class="person">Abu’l-Hasan Alî Ebn Muhammed Samírí</span>, and this was
the last Vakíl. When he was sick, the Shíâhs asked
him: “Who shall after thee be the Vakíl of the holy
place?” He wrote his command by a last will,
by which he abolished the charge, and the command
is as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote">In the name of the bountiful and merciful God:</p>

<p class="blockquote">O Ali, son of Muhammed Samiri, may God increase the
recompense of thy brothers with regard to thee, for thou art
dead, and between thee and me there are six days;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_579" id="fnanchor_579"></a><a href="#footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></span>
therefore
arrange thy affairs, and propose to nobody to fill thy
place after thy death; certainly the complete absence is now
accomplished, and no further manifestation shall take place
but after the permission of God, the most high. He mentioned
it, and this after a long delay, and the obduracy of
hearts, and after the filling of the earth with violence. And
there shall come from among my people one to be a witness;
but he who desires it before the coming forth of a Safiani and
the Sihat, he is a deceiver, and ought to be avoided. There
is no power and no strength but one God, the most high and
most great.</p>

<p>Abul-Hasan died in the middle of Shâbán (the
eighth month of the year), in the year of the Hejira
328 (A. D. 939).</p>

<p>It is to be known, that the tradition among the
Shiâhs of the <span class="title">Imámiyat-âsulín</span> sect is divided into
<a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pageno">386</span>
four parts: <dfn>sáhíh</dfn>, “authentic;” <dfn>hasen</dfn>, “elegant;”
<dfn>músik</dfn>, “strong;” and <dfn>sâíf</dfn>, “weak.”</p>

<p>An <dfn>hadís sahih</dfn>, “an authentic tradition,” is one,
the authority of which goes back to <span class="trans">mâsúm</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_580" id="fnanchor_580"></a><a href="#footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></span>
according
to the narration of an <dfn>âdil Imám</dfn>, “a just Imám,”
in the description of whom the <dfn>árbáb-i-hadis</dfn>, “the
masters of history,” have used the word <span class="trans">âdil</span>,
whether the narrator be one person, or whether
there be more than one, provided in the description
of them all the same language has been used.</p>

<p>An <dfn>hadis hasen</dfn>, “an elegant tradition,” is one, the
authority of which goes back, like that of the <span class="trans">hadis
sahih</span>, to the <span class="trans">mâsúm</span>; but, according to the narrative
of a venerable Imám, in this way, that although, in
regard to the narrator of it, the words <dfn>sikah âdíl</dfn>,
“trusty and just,” have not come down to us from
the historians, yet they have praised him in other
words.</p>

<p>An <dfn>hadis músik</dfn>, “a strong tradition,” is that, in
the description of whose narrators the words <span class="trans">sikah
âdil</span> have been used by the historians, but some
<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a><span class="pageno">387</span>
or all of the narrators of which are not <dfn>Imámís</dfn>, “followers
of Ali.”</p>

<p>An <dfn>hadis sâíf</dfn>, “a weak tradition,” is that in which
none of these three conditions are found; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: 1st,
the inference from the commendation of <span class="trans">sikah âdil</span>;
2nd, a praise other than these two words; and 3rd,
the qualification <span class="trans">sikah âdil</span>, with erroneous belief on
the part of the narrator.</p>

<p>A tradition is either <em>in regular succession</em>, or <em>not in
regular succession</em>. A tradition is in regular succession,
when a great multitude on the authority of
a great multitude make the same narration, until it
reaches to the <span class="trans">mâsúm</span>, in such a manner, that the
number of each multitude, in each particular age,
shall have been so great as to exclude the idea of
their having combined in telling a lie. A tradition
is without a regular succession, when the number
of narrators does not, in all or several stages,
reach to that multitude, as before said, and this kind
of tradition is called, in the peculiar idiom of the
masters of history, <em>the information of one</em>. Among
the Akhbarians, there is no such arrangement and
classification of evidence, and God knows the
truth.</p>

<p>The author of this book writes what he has learned
of the religion of the <span class="title">Akhbáríns</span> from the Amíns of this
doctrine, one of whom was Muhammed Razái Kazvíní.
They call themselves <dfn>Akhbárín</dfn>, “dogmatic
<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pageno">388</span>
Traditionists,” because they place the centre of
their belief in the prophetic book,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_581" id="fnanchor_581"></a><a href="#footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></span>
and employ no
reasoning. <span class="person">Mulla Muhammed Amín</span>, after having acquired
the requisite theoretical and practical knowledge
and that of the law, went to Mecca and to the
revered places, and he declared openly, that controversial
dialectics belong not to the rule of the ancient
Shiâhs. The author of this book writes what he
has heard from pious persons, the confidents of
secrets of this sect; whoever desires to know more
of it, may have recourse to the book <span class="title">Faváid Almadíniy</span>,
which is the composition of the last mentioned
writer.</p>

<p>The following passage is said to be found in the
sacred writings:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“God take compassion on the man of whom I know whence he
comes, where he is, and whither he goes.”</p>

<p>My desire is God himself, and as an indication of
it is my perception of him, the scope of which is
the return to him. Afterwards we ought to have the
knowledge of three perceptions. The <span class="title">Imánah</span> conform
themselves to the religion of the community
which is composed of the people of the temple; but
it is required that we acquire in Medina the knowledge
of what the prophet is, and that we enter
through the doors (chapters) of sciences, in which
<a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span class="pageno">389</span>
twelve Imáms are to be praised; whatever further is
behind this religion will belong to that of the heretics.
Of the two other religions, the one is that of
the <em>people of pious austerity</em>; and this again is divided
into two sects: the one comprehends the ancient
<dfn>Ashrákíán</dfn>, who did not follow the prophet; and the
second consists of the <dfn>Matákherîn</dfn>, “the moderns,”
who, known under the name of “Sufis,” believe
the prophet, and in theory and practice conform
themselves to him and to the Imáms. They say,
the prophet showed the way of righteousness and
revealed the hidden; and the Imáms also taught
purity, which from them was conveyed to us; the
Imáms, by their pious austerity, promoted the
purity of manners, and practised abstinence from
food and sleep; the lord of the prophetic protection
committed this religion to Alí; and Alí was the
delegate of this pious austerity, the chief master, the
Amir of the true believers; <span class="person">Hassan Baśri</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_582" id="fnanchor_582"></a><a href="#footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></span>
was one of
<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pageno">390</span>
the devoted followers of the Amír, and <span class="person">Báyazîd</span> was
the disciple of the Imám <span class="person">Jâfr sadek</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_583" id="fnanchor_583"></a><a href="#footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></span>
<span class="person">Mârúf Kœrkhí</span>,
“the celebrated of Karkh,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_584" id="fnanchor_584"></a><a href="#footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></span>
gave the hand of devotedness
to the Imám <span class="person">Reza</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_585" id="fnanchor_585"></a><a href="#footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></span>
Similar to them is the
sect <dfn>shigref</dfn>, “the venerable,” who think themselves
the vice-regents of the Imáms, and lieutenants of the
prophet (the peace of God be upon him):<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></span> their sayings
deserve no attention, as in our religion there
never was a lieutenant, whatever from a spirit of
vanity they may assume. These men are professedly
monks, and these are numbered among
heretics.</p>

<p>The second sect is that of the <dfn>Istidlal</dfn>, “the arguers,”
and of old<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_586" id="fnanchor_586"></a><a href="#footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></span>
they were called <span class="title">Masháyín</span>,
<a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a><span class="pageno">391</span>
“the walkers, peripatetics;” they did not follow the
prophet, and the moderns call them <dfn>Matkalemín</dfn>,
“scholastics.” These sectaries are said to mix the
principles of the true faith with the belief of the
peripatetics, and are also reckoned heretics:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_587" id="fnanchor_587"></a><a href="#footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></span>
because
the true religion is that which the lord professed,
and this is the religion of the Akhbárins.</p>

<p>Mulla Muhammed Amîn<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_588" id="fnanchor_588"></a><a href="#footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></span>
addressed a crowd of
<dfn>mujtahids</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_589" id="fnanchor_589"></a><a href="#footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></span>
“casuists,” who make a profession of
ratiocination (discussion), in the following terms:&mdash;“You
<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pageno">392</span>
agree and acknowledge, that the ancient
believers and the religion of old knew of no contentious
arguing; and that the ancient way and the old
religion which prevailed in the time of Muhammed
and of the Imáms (the peace of God be upon them!)
is the way of the Akhbarîns. Further, we have likewise
a satisfactory proof, that our way is the constant
religion; but try to combine a demonstration
in the way of reasoning, and show to us by whose
direction from among the possessors of holiness you
adopted your creed, whilst after Muhammed (the
peace of God be upon him!) no other prophet is to
appear and to bring another religion? In like manner
it has not been stated, in the book of the prophet
and in the sacred sayings of the Apostles and
of the Imáms, that the relators should, in practice
act at discretion, and after the disappearing of the
Imám, make a profession of ratiocination. Moreover,
it is positively understood that you have mixed
your principles with the principles of the Sonnites
and Jamáat, and your creed has taken the nature of
oxymel, which is neither honey nor vinegar; and
you are neither Sonnites nor Shiâhs; and this is the
manner in which the moderns exercise reasoning as
a profession, that, in the time of religious zeal, they
went and helped themselves to the acquisition of
knowledge from the books of the adversaries (schismatics),
and a similar desire has taken hold of your
<a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a><span class="pageno">393</span>
hearts. Afterwards they threw out of their books
what appeared reprovable, but nevertheless mixed
something of it with their own faith.”</p>

<p>It should be known that some things proceed
from the exigencies of the faith: thus the dissentient
as well as the consentient use the same prayers, and
even the unbelievers admit, that in these Muhammed
is necessarily honoured. Several things are
among the exigencies of the faith, as for instance the
office of an Imám, as the dissentient and consentient
know that, in point of faith, acknowledging the
Imáms is indispensable for strength, firmness, and
unimpairable stability. It should be known that,
whatever is established from the verses of the Koran
renders the conforming of the action to it indispensable;
but what is expressed in an allegorical or
ambiguous sense, we have not the capacity of understanding;
it is then evident that this is particular to
the prophet and to the Imáms, and we should not
meddle with it; further, we ought to conform our
actions to the tradition of the prophet and of the
Imáms. As many traditions are opposed to each
other, and the distinction therein is arduous; on
that account, if two traditions present themselves to
our view, such as to be contrary to each other, then
the Imám affords the believers a firm rule, which
proves to the understanding a protection from
error. The truth is, that when two traditions
<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span class="pageno">394</span>
happen to contradict each other, <em>good Theologians</em>
refer them to the incontrovertible authority of the
Koran; the tradition which is conformable to a
verse of the Koran, is that to which they refer the
action, and ascribe to religious zeal<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_590" id="fnanchor_590"></a><a href="#footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></span>
the other tradition,
and if this does not coincide with the incontrovertible
authority, as it exceeds your power to
decide the dubious question; fix then your eyes upon
the creed of the opposers, and observe by what rule
they are actuated.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_591" id="fnanchor_591"></a><a href="#footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></span>
Whatever is contrary to them,
this tradition they should reckon to be truth; and
whatever agrees with the opposers, they should
acknowledge as belonging to religious zeal; and if
both these traditions in the creed of the opposers
were laudable, they should consider, that a thing
which according to them deserves pre-eminence, is
the contrary of that which they ought to take. And
if one says: “You have many opposers, and there
are seventy-and-two sects whose opinions are
conflicting with each other;” <em>I answer</em>: “The
Imám declared that they ought to proceed upon
a road contrary to that upon which the victorious,
the rulers, and the learned among the opposers,
walk; and if, nevertheless, it may appear to all
<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a><span class="pageno">395</span>
that they find themselves upon the same road;
there are then two laws: according to whichever
of the traditions they act, it does not matter in
that tradition in which way it comes from the
<span class="trans">mâsúm</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_592" id="fnanchor_592"></a><a href="#footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></span>
provided, without doubt, it comes from
the Imám; and the Imám is a person to whom
obedience is obligatory. Moreover, by whichever
authority they act, they must conform their action
to the direction of the Imám. Another thing is
to be said: “Have patience until the time of the
happy meeting with the Imâm.” If any body
says: “We have no option to act or not to act;
how long shall we wait? the coming of the Imám
is not determined?” This is the reply: Having
already acted, why should it be said: “Have patience?”
This has reference to <em>the precept</em>: “If
thou art in business, act peaceably; and if devoted
to religion, follow the rites of the most comprehensive
religion.” Should any one say: “To
conform my actions to this rule is also subject to
discussion,” we answer to that: “This is the
rule the Imám has established; if there be discussion,
it is therefore the Imám’s, not our’s.” To
weigh a religious doctrine is the same as to compare
two traditions contrary to each other: we found,
for instance, that “as to purity of wine, there are
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pageno">396</span>
two colors.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_593" id="fnanchor_593"></a><a href="#footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></span>
The wine is in the traditions;
we then made reference to the incontrovertible
authority of the Koran; we found no verse decisive
about it; and in the allegories we saw, that wine is
called uncleanness, and how many meanings are
attached to uncleanness; and as we had the power
of understanding the truth, the ambiguity disappeared.
We made reference to the creed of the
opposers <em>to the right faith</em>: they acknowledge wine to
be impure. Then we took the contrary of it, and
reckoned the wine to be pure, as the traditions
announce the purity of wine. Further, the tradition
which denotes the impurity of wine, we ascribed
to religious caution. And it is to be known
that the Mujtahíd ought to conform his actions to his
opinion; but opinion is <dfn>shabhah</dfn>, “doubt,” and is so
called (very like <dfn>shabah</dfn>, “an image”), because it is
vain, and “truth-like.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pageno">397</span>
The religion of the Akhbarín consists in the
conviction that, without an exception, whatever
they have heard from the Imám is to them <dfn>dalîl-i-katáí</dfn>,
“a final, decisive proof” (cutting off all
further questions); moreover the practice followed
by the Akhbaríns, is the <dfn>terík-í-katáí</dfn>, “the
final religion;” and <dfn>katáí</dfn>, “final,” is that which
does not depend upon <em>mere</em> opinion. The modern
among the Shiâh said, that it becomes the Mujtahed
to conform his actions to his opinions, and
that it is incumbent upon others to submit to his
doctrine: this religion is not ancient; as to the rest,
the practice of contentious arguing and restlessness
is an error.</p>

<p class="center small">AN ACCOUNT OF THE ISMAI LIAH.</p>

<p>Information was received from Mír Amír, who
was a governor of the Naváhi, “district” of the
town Shekúnah, that the Ismâílíah, are a tribe
among the Shiâhs; and their creed is ascribed to the
lord Imám Ismâíl, the son of the lord Imám Jâfr
sádik,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_594" id="fnanchor_594"></a><a href="#footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></span>
and this sect believe this lord an Imam; they
<a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a><span class="pageno">398</span>
say, that Imám Jâfr consigned the office of an Imám
to him; and that he never admitted to a partnership
with the mother of this lord any other woman or
girl, in the manner that had been done by the prophet
with regard to Khadíjah, and by Alí with respect
to Fátmah.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_595" id="fnanchor_595"></a><a href="#footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></span>
About the departure of Ismâíl
from this perishable world, there are different accounts.
Some say that he died during the lifetime
of Jâfr; then the prerogative of appointing to the
Imámate was transferred from the Imám Jâfr to the
offspring of Ismâíl; in like manner as Músí (Moses)
transferred the appointment to Hárún (Aaron), who
died during the lifetime of Músí. The appointment
does not return by retrocession; and a convention
<em>reversed</em> from whence it came is impossible. Jáfr
was not likely to appoint, without traditional credentials
<a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pageno">399</span>
from noble ancestors, one from among his
distinguished descendants, and to be uncertain and
unknown is not suitable to an Imám. As to the
appointment of the Imám Jáfr, its legality is in
accordance with the twelve Imáms. Some say, that
Ismâíl had not departed from life, but the news of
his death was spread about, from fear that his enemies
should attempt his life, and a declaration of his
death was written. It is reported, according to
some, that during the khalifat of Manzur, Ismâil was
seen in Basra, where a person afflicted with a malady
of the foot was cured by means of his prayers. Mansur
asked information from the Imám, who sent to
the khalif a certificate (of Ismâil’s death), in which
was included a letter of the âamil (collector of revenue)
of Mansur.</p>

<p>They say that, after Ismâil followed Muhammed,
the son of Ismâil, with whom closed the series of
the Shiâh Imáms,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_596" id="fnanchor_596"></a><a href="#footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></span>
and after him the Imáms disappeared;
but no age remains destitute of conspicuous
Imáms, and when an Imám has appeared, he certainly
evinces himself as such.</p>

<p><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pageno">400</span>
The number of the commands of the Imáms is
seven, like the seven days of the week, the seven
heavens, and the seven planets.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_597" id="fnanchor_597"></a><a href="#footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></span>
They hold the
number of the religious leaders to be twelve, and
therein the Imámíyas have committed an error, by
counting the Imáms after the leaders, and these are
the <dfn>Baténian</dfn>, “interior.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_598" id="fnanchor_598"></a><a href="#footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></span>
These sectaries do not
<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pageno">401</span>
conform themselves to the evidence of the divine
law; they declare: “we do not say, God is omnipresent
or not omnipresent, omniscient, or not omniscient,
almighty, or not almighty, and so in all
attributes;” they maintain further as a confirmation
of the truth, that there is a connexion between
God and the <em>other</em> beings, and this is the creed of
the <dfn>Tashbíah</dfn>, “assimilators;” but from an absolute
negation a connexion takes place with non-existences,
which is maintained by the <dfn>Tâtíl</dfn>, “indifferent,”
and the application of this thesis to the
Lord, the self-existent, leads to the opinion, that
there is no community to be imagined between the
Lord God, self-existent, <em>and other beings</em>. They also
say that the Almighty God is the operator of opposite
effects, and the creator and ruler of conflicting
results. They further set forth, that when the lord
Yzed, the most sublime, bestowed the gift of knowledge
<a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pageno">402</span>
upon the inhabitants of the world, they called
him all-knowing; when he displayed his power on
account of his majesty, they called him all-mighty:
certainly the attribution of knowledge and power to
the being of the most sublime Yzed is founded upon
the belief that he is the giver of knowledge and force.
Moreover they assert that, by a single command,
God created intelligence, which among all things is
perfect, and by means of perfect intelligence, he
brought forth the spirit which is not perfect; there
is a relation between intelligence and spirit, a relation
between the sperm and the child produced, as
well as a relation between the egg and the bird, or
a relation between father and son, or husband and
wife. The spirit becomes then desirous of, and
longing for the excellence of perfect intelligence<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_599" id="fnanchor_599"></a><a href="#footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></span>
which he derives from expansion, therefore he feels
himself pressed to move out of his deficiencies towards
excellence,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_600" id="fnanchor_600"></a><a href="#footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></span>
but he does not attain at perfect
motion, except by means of an instrument.</p>

<p>Afterwards, God created the heavenly bodies, and
gave the heavens a circular motion; from his disposition
emerged the spirit, the simple elementary natures,
<a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a><span class="pageno">403</span>
and by means of them the uncompounded
beings; further, he brought forth the compounded
bodies from among minerals, vegetables, and various
animals, among which man was the best, on account
of the merit of much sanctity, and his connexion
with the celestial world. Thus the upper world is
composed of perfect universal intelligence, and the
rational sense of universality which is the origin of
creatures. It is necessary that in the nether world
perfect universal intelligence and reason prevail,
that they may afford to the inhabitants of the world
the means of salvation, and this intelligence is the
prophet <dfn>nát´ik</dfn>, “speaking,” and the reason is the
Imám. As the heavens are moved by the impulse
of intelligence and reason, in like manner are the
other souls set free by the impulse of the “speaker;”
there is one who commands in every age, and every
time has its revolution; every revolution depends
upon the authority of seven persons<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_601" id="fnanchor_601"></a><a href="#footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></span>
until it terminates
<a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pageno">404</span>
by the last revolution and the time of judgment
comes; the exigencies of the law and religious
rule rise as the rapid movements of heaven, and the
necessity of law is the cause of the acquisition of
reason <em>carried</em> to excellence; it is a <em>laudable</em> trial of
mankind to attain to the dignity of wisdom, and this
is “the great judgment.”</p>

<p>When they wish to convert any body to their
creed, they throw doubts upon his religion into his
mind, not with any evil intention on their side, but
that he may find the road to God and attain truth, as
well as be convinced that, except their religion, any
other is remote from certainty and without firmness.
Their manner of creating doubts about the pillars of
the law, is that they ask about detached parts of a
sura: what (for instance) is the meaning of the detached
letters in the first sura,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_602" id="fnanchor_602"></a><a href="#footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></span>
and the command
<a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a><span class="pageno">405</span>
about fasting, a menstruous woman, the command
of prayers, and why the necessity of bathing with
regard to sperm and urine; the number of the sacred
inclinations of the head, which, according to some,
are four, according to others, three, and perhaps
two: which number is right? and so on in all actions
of the pious.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_603" id="fnanchor_603"></a><a href="#footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></span>
When the person desirous of truth,
finds himself by such questions surrounded with
doubts, and inquires after truth, they answer, and
conduct him upon the road of the right belief, in
such a manner that all doubt is banished from his
heart; he then is received in their community, and
<a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a><span class="pageno">406</span>
walks in the right way, whence he is strengthened
against any creation of doubts, and this is the manner
of agreement current among the followers of
God, by way of compact and convention.</p>

<p class="center small">“When we took engagements with the prophets.”</p>

<p>Further, according to convention, comes <dfn>haválet</dfn>,
“giving in charge” to the Imám, and settling arduous
matters, when a difficulty occurs in an affair
which presents itself to him; inasmuch as, by the
laudable nature of his qualities, an Imám is wise,
and nobody else possesses the power with which this
exalted personage is firmly invested. To this is
joined <dfn>tedlís</dfn>, “artifice,” which consists in managing
relations with powerful personages, in religious and
worldly matters, in order to increase the proselyte’s
inclination for what he seeks and wishes. Then is
<dfn>tásís</dfn>, “making sure,” or confirming the arrangements
which are agreeable to him, so that he may
be confident, and put in possession of what he expects.
Further, there is <dfn>khalâ</dfn>, “divesting,” which
is obscure. Afterwards by renouncing the actions
of this world: this is <dfn>silkh</dfn>, “estrangement from the
observances of exterior religion.” Finally, at
this period, whoever may find it agreeable to indulge
in, and to excite himself to, pleasurable practices,
and to interpret the law, which is the office of exalted
personages, <em>he may do so</em>, as whatever in the
<a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pageno">407</span>
world is not hurtful, is proper to the favourites of
God, as for instance wine, which, to enjoy with
moderation and without abuse and noise, is salutary.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_604" id="fnanchor_604"></a><a href="#footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a><span class="pageno">408</span>
They say likewise <dfn>vazu</dfn>, “ablution,” is as much
as acknowledging the faith of the Imám, and abstersion
with sand (from want of water) the same in the
absence of the Imám, as he is the umpire. <dfn>Namaz</dfn>,
“prayer,” is a precept of the prophet, according to
the word of God the Almighty.</p>

<p class="center small">“Prayer preserveth from filthy crimes, and from what is blameable.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_605" id="fnanchor_605"></a><a href="#footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Jhtilám</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_606" id="fnanchor_606"></a><a href="#footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></span>
“nocturnal pollution,” refers to the
divulging of a secret to a person not one of those
who ought to know it, without the intention of
guiding him into the right road. <dfn>Ghasel</dfn>, “bathing,”
is a renewal of the covenant. <dfn>Zakat</dfn>, “alms,” is
the sanctifying of life by means of the understanding
of mankind. <dfn>Súm</dfn>, “fasting,” denotes
the preservation of the mysteries of the Imám.
<dfn>Zena</dfn>, “sexual intercourse with a strange woman,”
is equivalent to divulging the mysteries of religion.
These sectaries say also that praying in an assembly
<a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a><span class="pageno">409</span>
is following the holy Imám. The alms are to them
a metaphoric signification of the fifth part of property
which they give to the Imám.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_607" id="fnanchor_607"></a><a href="#footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></span>
Further,
there is the <span class="title">Kábah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_608" id="fnanchor_608"></a><a href="#footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></span>
of the prophet, the <dfn>bâb</dfn>, “door,”
of Alí, the <span class="trans">śafá</span> of the apostle, the <span class="trans">marvah</span> of the
<dfn>vasí</dfn>, “executor,” the <dfn>míkát itinás</dfn>, “the place of
familiarity” (where the pilgrims assemble and
whence they proceed to perform the solemnities at
the temple of Mecca), and the <dfn>talbiyat</dfn>, “pilgrimage
of obedience” to the blessed; the <em>seven circuits</em>,
around the house of lordship which the Shiâhs
devote to the Imâms (the peace of God be upon
them!)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_609" id="fnanchor_609"></a><a href="#footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a><span class="pageno">410</span>
Heaven is repose of bodies from all distresses.
Hell is the torment of bodies by distresses.</p>

<p>And in this manner they interpret every thing,
and say that every thing exterior has its interior,
which is the cause of the exterior, whilst this latter
is the manifestation of the interior; and there is nothing
exterior which has not its interior; and if not,
there is, in reality, nothing; further, there is nothing
interior which has not its exterior, unless it
be an illusion. When God created the exterior
(visible), and the interior (invisible) world, the latter
was the world of spirits, souls, and intelligences;
the visible world was that of bodies, upper and
nether, and of accidents. The Imám is the lord of
the interior world, and there is no knowledge of
God to be acquired, except by his instruction. The
prophet is the lord of the exterior world, and the
law, of which men stand in need, will not be perfect
<a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a><span class="pageno">411</span>
except by him; and the law has an exterior side,
which is called <span class="title">tanzil</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_610" id="fnanchor_610"></a><a href="#footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></span>
“revelation from heaven,
the Koran,” and an interior, which is entitled
<dfn>táwîl</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_611" id="fnanchor_611"></a><a href="#footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></span>
“interpretation.” The age is never destitute
of a prophet, or of law; it is likewise never
without an Imám, or his authority. These sectaries
further say, that his government is sometimes
concealed, although the Imám be manifest, and that
at another time the government is manifest, although
the Imám be concealed; in such a manner that the
people may know a prophet by the wonders of his
words and deeds; but they recognize the Imám by
his government and direction, and they cannot
know God Almighty but by the Imám. The Shiâhs
also maintain that the existence of an Imám through
all times is necessary, whether manifest or concealed,
so that no period of time be destitute of the
splendour of the sun, or plunged in the darkness of
night.</p>

<p>A book was seen, composed by Hassan Sábáh,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_612" id="fnanchor_612"></a><a href="#footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></span>
who was a deputy of the Imám. In the first chapter
<a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a><span class="pageno">412</span>
of it, he says, that the <dfn>mufti</dfn>, “wise,” in the
knowledge of the Lord God ought to follow one of
the two sentences: either that which says that
he may know God by mere reason, without the
aid of instruction by an intelligent <dfn>sádik</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_613" id="fnanchor_613"></a><a href="#footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></span>
“a
sincere friend,” or that which declares that the
knowledge of the Lord God by reason is difficult,
and cannot be acquired unless by the instruction
of an intelligent sincere friend; and he further
states, that whatever decision he may give according
to the first sentence, he does not assume
to reject the other, because, when he rejects, the
rejection amounts to teaching and demonstrating,
that the disavowal of the posterity of Alí is required
by the other. These sectarians say, that
both modes are necessary, and constitute a proof:
because the muftí, when he gives a decision by a
sentence, this sentence is either his own or that
of another; in the same way, when he professes
a creed, either he adopts it firmly from his own
original persuasion, or this sense is communicated
to him by another. This is what the first
section <em>of the book before mentioned</em> contains. In the
contents of this section is a digression upon the
lords of reason and of wisdom.</p>

<p><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a><span class="pageno">413</span>
In the second section of it, we read the statement
that, when there is an occasion for a teacher, either
every intelligent man, by a free use of his ability,
gives instruction, or the learned sádik is indispensable;
and the author says, that a person who may
agree with whatever instruction an able master imparts,
will not think it allowable to carry on controversy
with this learned antagonist; and when he
permits himself to do so, certainly he may have
kept the faith which is absolutely due to the learned
<em>śaáik</em> and confidential friend. This section is said
to contain a digression upon the lords of the tradition.</p>

<p>In the third section it is stated that, although
the necessity of a learned <span class="trans">sádik</span> be established, yet
it is required to take advantage of the knowledge of
the first learned man; and after the instruction received
from him, that is, instruction from any
teacher without a special appointment, it is proper
to be assured of his truth; as the right way of
religion is not attainable without a companion,
certainly the first concern is to have a <em>true</em> friend.
After this subject, there is a digression upon the
Shiâhs.</p>

<p>In the fourth chapter, the author says, that the
individuals of mankind are divided into two classes.</p>

<p><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a><span class="pageno">414</span>
The one says: “We require for the knowledge of
the Creator a learned <dfn>sádik</dfn>, or sincere friend; and
his special appointment is required, and after that
instruction from him.” The other class says,
“Instruction for the knowledge of any science can be
obtained from any person, whether a master or
not a master <em>specially appointed</em>.” As, by previous
investigations, it is understood that the truth is with
the first class, certainly the chief and leader of the
first class will be the chief of the philosophers; and
as it has been ascertained that the second class is
erring, their leader is the leader of the deceived.
The author says further, the <em>true</em> doctrine is, that we
acknowledge the <dfn>muhikk</dfn>, “him who knows for certain”
<dfn>bahakk</dfn>, that is, “in truth,” which is a summary
knowledge; and after the summary knowledge by
which we recognise “him who knows for certain,”
“in truth,” we want a detailed (distinct) knowledge
of these questions; and our purpose in using
the word <dfn>bahakk</dfn>, “in truth” is to express the
necessity of having a <span class="trans">muhikk</span>, and the author says:
By necessity we are to know the Imám, and by the
Imám we know God in such a manner that by lawfulness
we acknowledge him who is necessary,
that is to say, that we acknowledge by the possibility
of perfection the existence of the self-existent
being.</p>

<p>The author also says, that knowing the <em>true</em> doctrine
<a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a><span class="pageno">415</span>
is knowing the unity <em>of God</em>. After this illustration,
having in several sections exhibited an
account of his own faith, and in some established
it, he made in other sections a digression
upon the creed of others, and the digressive sections
are frequent; the proofs and disquisitions
by controversy with regard to false religions, and
the disquisitions by concordance with regard to the
rightfulness of his own religion, are distinct from
the totality of those arguments, which are between
truth and falsehood, and the contrast between truth
and falsehood, and that between small and great <em>is
made evident</em>. The author further alleges, that in
science there is truth and falsehood; but the distinguishing
mark of truth is unity, and the distinguishing
mark of falsehood is multiformity; unity is
related to <em>authoritative</em> instruction, and multiformity
is related to opinion; instruction belongs to the
assembly, and the assembly to the Imám; opinion is
allied with conflicting sects, and these agree with
their chiefs. As for the separation of truth from
falsehood, and the resemblance which truth has
with falsehood, and for the distinction between what
is consistent and what is absurd, on both sides, a
balance ought to be formed in which every thing
may be weighed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_614" id="fnanchor_614"></a><a href="#footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></span>
The author moreover says, that
<a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a><span class="pageno">416</span>
we obtained the knowledge of this balance from the
speeches of the witnesses, and whatever is compounded
of negation and affirmation; and whatever
is deserving negation is falsehood; and whatever
is deserving affirmation is truth; and by this balance
we weigh the good and bad, the sincere and the
lying, and all contradictions; and the acute distinction
and mystery of this speech is, that in the
sentences each word relates to truth by proof of
evidence, and unity and confirmation. The Imámate
unites itself with prophecy in such a degree that
prophecy, by the very nature of the Imámate, is
prophecy; and this is the scope of the discourse in
these topics of inquiry.</p>

<p>Besides, the author forbade the vulgar to dive
deeply into science; and he prohibited the nobles
the study of the books of the ancients, unless there
was a person fit to master the particulars of their
contents, and the comparative merits of the men
who have delivered speeches. He also determined,
with his companions in divinity, to say: <cite>illah illah
Muhammed ast</cite>, “God is God the praise-worthy;”
so you; but the adversaries say: <dfn>illah illah akel ast</dfn>,
“God is God the wise;” that is, whatever is reason,
every reason takes its direction towards the side of
this leader (Muhammed); and as some of them raise
<a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a><span class="pageno">417</span>
these questions: “God Almighty is he present or
not? one or many? knowing or ignorant? powerful
or not?” An answer sufficiently strong is
given, namely: <dfn>illah ba illah Muhammed</dfn>, “God by
God is praiseworthy:”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_615" id="fnanchor_615"></a><a href="#footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></span>
as it is God who sent the
prophet for leading the creatures, and the prophet is
the leader of the creatures.</p>

<p>These sectaries are to be found in many places,
but in great numbers in the <dfn>navahi</dfn>, “district,” of
the eastern Kohistan, in the districts of Khita, of
Káshghar, and Tibet. The author of this book saw,
in the year of the Hejira 1054 (A. D. 1644), in Multan,
one belonging to this sect, called Mír Alî Akbar,
and heard frequently this account from his mouth:
The Khalifs of the Ismâílíah maintained, during a
long time, their dignity in the West. The lineage
of the first Khalifs, according to the manner which is
agreed upon among the Ismâílíah, is stated as follows:
Khájah<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_616" id="fnanchor_616"></a><a href="#footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></span>
Násir Túsi (of Tús) showed himself
<a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a><span class="pageno">418</span>
or really was, in his time, a professor of Ismâílísm.
Muhammed al mahtadí ben Abd-ullah, ben Ahmed
ben Muhammed, ben Ismâíl, ben Jâfr sádik, united
the dignity of the Imámate with his own nobility,
and declared that Mahdi, the last of the age, is represented
in Muhammed ben Abd-ullah, and he quoted
from the writing of Sádik, who said: “<cite>At the end of
thirteen hundred years, the sun shall rise in the west.</cite>”
They say that the word <dfn>sun</dfn> in this sentence alludes
to Muhammed, son of Abd-ullah.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_617" id="fnanchor_617"></a><a href="#footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></span>
They give to
Abú yazíd, who fell off from the lord (Sadik), the
name of Antichrist (dajál).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_618" id="fnanchor_618"></a><a href="#footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a><span class="pageno">419</span>
A great number of learned men are followers
of the Ismâílíah: such was <span class="person">Amír Náśer Khusró</span>,
from among all learned poets, the contemporary
of Ismâíl, surnamed <dfn>Montáser</dfn>, “the victorious.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_619" id="fnanchor_619"></a><a href="#footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></span>
Amir Naser<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_620" id="fnanchor_620"></a><a href="#footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></span>
was born in the year of the Hejira
359 (A. D. 969). When he arrived at the age of
discernment and rectitude, he heard the voice of
Hassen, <em>teaching</em> the morals of the Ismâílíah, in the
time of the khalifat of the legitimate Imám Montáser;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_621" id="fnanchor_621"></a><a href="#footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></span>
he hastened from Khorassan to Egypt,
<a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a><span class="pageno">420</span>
where he dwelt seven years; every year he made
a pilgrimage to Mecca, and returned from thence;
he was exceedingly devoted to the practice of the
law. At last he went to Mecca, and returning by
the way of Baśra (Bussora) he was disposed to go
to Khorassan. Having fixed himself in Sabakh, he
invited mankind to the khalifat of Manteśer, and
to the religion of the Ismâíliah, and showed the way
to it. Hence, a number of the enemies of the prophet’s
descendants wished to destroy Amír Nás r
Khusró. A prey to fear and terror, he concealed
himself from mountain to mountain in Badakhshan,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_622" id="fnanchor_622"></a><a href="#footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></span>
and lived twenty years upon water and grass
in inaccessible places. Some of the ignorant reckoned
him a companion among the Ismâíliah Almutíah;
others of the uninformed composed a book
of regret on the subject of his alliance with the
Almutíah which they supposed: the fact is that
he, following the Ismâílíah of the West, kept no
communication nor society with the Almútíah. This
is what we have heard from the Ismâílíah with
<a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a><span class="pageno">421</span>
regard to Nás r, and what is also recorded in historical
books.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_623" id="fnanchor_623"></a><a href="#footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a><span class="pageno">422</span>
The Imáms of the Ismâílíah showed themselves
very kind to all creatures. Thus Manśur, the son
of Azíz, known under the name of Alhákem ba amra
allah, an Ismáílah, ordered in Egypt that, for the
convenience of purchase and sale, the doors of the
shops should be kept open at night, and the windows
of Cairo not shut, that besides torches should be
lighted in the narrow streets the whole night, and the
people freely move in the market places and squares.
This lord was skilful in all sciences, and powerful in
prodigies, like his glorious ancestor Muhammed
Mokhtar. Thus he said: “in such a night, a misfortune
will befall me:” and so it happened.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_624" id="fnanchor_624"></a><a href="#footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span class="pageno">423</span>
The Imáms of the western Ismâílíah were all zealous
in the practices of exterior worship, and an
account of them is published in the historical books.
The Ismâílíah of Iran are celebrated with the Ismâílíah
of Kohistán and Rúdbár.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_625" id="fnanchor_625"></a><a href="#footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></span>
The first of the
former was <span class="person">Hassan</span>, son of <span class="person">Sábáh</span>. As the account
of him in the histories has been traced with the pen
of partiality, therefore I shall endeavor to make a
statement such as obtains credit among the Ismâílíah
concerning him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_626" id="fnanchor_626"></a><a href="#footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></span></p>

<p>The lineage of Hassan is connected with Muhammed
Sabah Zamérí; his grandfather, who descended
from the family of Sábah Zamérí, came from Yemen
<a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a><span class="pageno">424</span>
to Kúfa, from Kúfa to Kam, and from Kam to Ráí.
His father is also said to have been Alí,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_627" id="fnanchor_627"></a><a href="#footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></span>
a person
devout and learned in the religion of Ismâílísm; he
found a livelihood in the country of Ráí. The
judge of this province, Abú Muslem Rází, on account
of the contrariety of religion, bore him enmity.
At the time when the Imám Mavafek Níshápúrí, one
of the most learned Sonnites, flourished in Khorássan,
the father (Alí), in order to remove from the suspicions
of the enemy, having brought his fortunate
son to Níshápúr, into the society of the Imam
Movafik, procured him the opportunity of being
intent upon his own advantage, whilst he himself,
seated in the corner of tranquillity, devoted himself
to piety. He never permitted himself speech above
the comprehension of the vulgar, for fear that any
person might consider them speeches of heretics and
infidels, and accuse him of impiety and irreligion.
Hassan was a condisciple of Nizam al mulk, of Tús,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_628" id="fnanchor_628"></a><a href="#footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></span>
<a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a><span class="pageno">425</span>
and Omar Khayám<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_629" id="fnanchor_629"></a><a href="#footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></span>
of Níshápúr. As his glorious
father had revealed to him that Nizám al Mulkh
would rise to a high rank of worldly greatness, and
Hassan to a great dignity, visible and invisible,
therefore Hassan said to Nizam al mulk: “Whichever
of us attains a high dignity, shall divide
the fortune by him acquired between us three
equally;” and in this sense they bound themselves
by a covenant. When khájah became a vizir
in the time of Alp Arselan,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_630" id="fnanchor_630"></a><a href="#footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></span>
then Hakím Omar
Khayám came to him, and in the corner of contemplative
retirement, devoted himself to the
acquisition of virtues. Khojah took no notice of
his arrival. Hassan expected that Nizam al mulk
would call him to his presence; disappointed in this,
<a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a><span class="pageno">426</span>
he, during the reign of Alp Arslan, did not join Khajah,
but in the time of Sultan Malik Shah<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_631" id="fnanchor_631"></a><a href="#footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></span>
he presented
himself in Níshápúr to Khajah, but the latter
did not mind the covenant that he had made, nor
introduce him to the assembly of the king. Helpless
then, the <dfn>Sayid al táífah</dfn>, “the chief of the sect,”
that is, Hassan, said to Khájah: “Thou belongest
to the learned, and to the companions of certainty,
and thou knowest that the world is a vile
object; should such a meanness be allowable,
that thou, on account of rank and the love of sway,
shouldst exhibit thyself a violator of promises,
and enter the number of those of whom it is
said: ‘They break the covenant of God.’”</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“Place the hand of faith into the girdle of promise,</div>
 <div class="i0">And endeavor to be no breaker of thy word.”</div>
</div>

<p>Khájah, perplexed, brought him to the court of
the Sultan, to whom he said much of Hassan’s sagacity,
but also gave information that the man was
violent, avaricious, inconsistent, and undeserving of
confidence. As Hassan was learned, and an able
man of business, therefore his piety and prudence
made in a short time a great impression upon the
<a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a><span class="pageno">427</span>
mind of the Sultan, who, in many great and important
affairs, acted according to his advice. As the
Sultan thought that what Khâja had said of the
inconsistency and avarice of Hassan’s character was
mere falsehood, and on account of other disorder,
some dissatisfaction with Khájah came into the Sultan’s
mind. One day he asked Khájah: “In what
time art thou able to settle a clear account, such
as that of a collector of the receipts and charges
of the empire?” Khájah replied: “In two
years.” The Sultan said: “That is a long time.”
Hassan took an engagement with the king that he
would bring it to a conclusion in forty days, under
the stipulation that, during this time, all the writers
should be at his service. The Sultan gave his
approbation to the proposal, and Hassan, faithful
to his promise, settled in forty days the account of
the finances of the empire with the utmost exactness.
Khájah, on hearing this intelligence, was troubled.
According to the account of some, a slave of Khájah,
who was upon terms of friendship with a servant
of Hassan, or according to others, Khájah himself,
took the register from the hands of the servant,
who was carrying the leaves of it outside the
king’s hall,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_632" id="fnanchor_632"></a><a href="#footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></span>
and mutilated the register. The servant
<a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a><span class="pageno">428</span>
brought to Hassan the leaves, without minding
their order and without mentioning to him the
occurrence; therefore, at the time of presenting the
register, Hassan found it mutilated, and intent upon
arranging and putting it in order, confused the leaves.
The Sultan was impatient to know the receipts,
charges, and revenues of the country; but Hassan
was not able to answer, and spoke with hesitation.
The Sultan, being vexed at meeting with such delay,
said: “What is the reason of these difficulties?” As
he received no answer, suitable to his questions, he
became agitated. Khájah Nizám ul mulk took the
opportunity to say: “Intelligent persons, to complete
this business, demanded a delay of two years;
an ignorant man pretends that, to finish it, forty
days are sufficient for this important work: his
answer to any question can but be insignificant.
I have formerly represented, that in his character
there is a total levity, and that his speeches
deserve no confidence.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_633" id="fnanchor_633"></a><a href="#footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></span>
On this account, the
<a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a><span class="pageno">429</span>
Sultan was displeased. Hassan consequently betook
himself to flight, and hastened to Rudbar, in
which country he found refuge with Abed-ul Malik
Atás, who was a follower of the Ismâílíah; from
thence he went to Isfahán, and, from fear of the
Sultan and of Khájah, he concealed himself in the
house of the Ráis Abulfazil. One day, in the midst
of conversation, it escaped from his tongue: “If I
found two proper friends, I would put in confusion
this Turk and his places.” The Ráís Abulfásil
ascribed this speech to a derangement of the
brain; and, without disclosing his idea to Hassan,
he prepared for him aliments, such as are proper
for strengthening the brain. Our Sáid Hassan,
from his great sagacity, having perceived the intention
of his mind, hastened from thence to another
place, and afterwards took possession of the fort
<span class="place">Almút</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_634" id="fnanchor_634"></a><a href="#footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></span>
The Ráis Abulfazil joined him. Our Sáid
<a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a><span class="pageno">430</span>
then said: “Is my brain deranged, or hast thou
not seen how, as soon as I had found two proper
friends, I have made good my word?”</p>

<p>At last, our Sáid went to Egypt, and at that time
Mantaśer<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_635" id="fnanchor_635"></a><a href="#footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></span>
an Ismâílíah, sat upon the throne of the
Khiláfet, and, being pleased with his sight, bestowed
favors upon him, wherefore Hassan remained one
year and a half under Montaśer’s protection. After
this, a great enmity arose between him and Amír
<span class="person">Aljíyúsh</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_636" id="fnanchor_636"></a><a href="#footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></span>
from this reason: Montaśer withdrew
from his son Nazár the succession to his dignity,
and issuing afterwards a second order, transferred
it to his other son Ahmed surnamed Almistálí
billah.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_637" id="fnanchor_637"></a><a href="#footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></span>
As a tumultuous concourse of the people
took place on that account, Amír Aljíyúsh approved
of the latter appointment, but Hassan said: “Respect
is due to the first nomination;” and he invited
the people to adhere to Nazár’s Imámate,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_638" id="fnanchor_638"></a><a href="#footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></span>
Amir
<a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a><span class="pageno">431</span>
Aljíyúsh, with the concurrence of some Umrá, represented
to Montas er that Hassan, on account of this
guilt, deserved to be imprisoned in the fort Damíat.
Soon after this was done, a tower of the rampart of
the fort, which was of a perfect strength, fell down,
wherefore the people apprehended a still greater
miracle from Hassan; at last the Amír Aljíyúsh sent
him, with some people of the Franks, on board a
ship bound to the West. The vessel was scarcely
in the open sea, when a violent wind began to blow,
the sea became boisterous, and the ship’s crew were
agitated; but Hassan showed himself in that state
of mind described by Amir Khusro:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“That thou mayst not be moved by every blast of wind,</div>
 <div class="i0">Draw in thy skirts (collect thyself) like a mountain;</div>
 <div class="i0">For man is but a handful of dust,</div>
 <div class="i0">And life is a violent storm.”</div>
</div>

<p>On this occasion one of the voyagers asked Hassan:
“What is the reason that I do not see thee disturbed?”
Hassan answered: “It is because the
Múláná, that is, the Imám, revealed to me that
no misfortune will befall the passengers of the
ship.” At the same moment, the tumult was
calmed. On that account, love for Hassan gained
the hearts of the whole company, and the vessel
went to one of the towns of the Nazaréens. Hassan
from thence embarked in another ship, and arrived
at the frontier of <span class="place">Shám</span> (Syria), where he landed.
<a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a><span class="pageno">432</span>
From thence he hastened to Haleb (Alep),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_639" id="fnanchor_639"></a><a href="#footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></span>
and then
satisfied his desire to go to Baghdad, from which
place he betook himself hastily to Khózistan, which
country he left for Isfahán: in this way he travelled,
concealed and clandestinely, in the countries of Irak
and Azerbáíjan, and invited the people to the doctrine
of the Ismáílíah, and to the Imámate of Nazár;
he sent <dfn>dáâis</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_640" id="fnanchor_640"></a><a href="#footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></span>
“missionaries,” to the fort <span class="place">Almút</span>,
and to other fastnesses and cities of Rúdbár and
Kohistán, that they might invite the people to the
true faith: in a short time, a great number of men
adopted this religion. Afterwards, having fixed his
abode in a place near Almút, he devoted himself
entirely to a religious life, to rectitude and the submission
to God, which was his very nature.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_641" id="fnanchor_641"></a><a href="#footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></span>
The
<a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a><span class="pageno">433</span>
inhabitants, having heard his followers, were converted
to his doctrine, and in the month of Rajeb
(December) in the year of the Hejira 484 (A. D.
1091), a troop of the inhabitants of Almút brought
this personage into the fort.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_642" id="fnanchor_642"></a><a href="#footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></span>
Finally, when he had
entered the fort, a chief, Alí Mahdî by name, who,
<a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a><span class="pageno">434</span>
under the authority of Sultan Malik shah, was governor
of this province, found himself bereft of power
and was obliged to submit. The adversaries of
the Ismâlíah say, that one day Alí Mahdî asserted,
“deception in law is allowable,” and gave an account
of some deceptions in religious law; but our
Sáid declared that, the centre of law being rectitude,
deception is not permitted, and all those who practise
deception, shall be brought to account for it
by God.</p>

<p>Some time after it, Hassan said one day to Mahdi:
“Sell to me for three thousand dinars as much of
the ground of this fort as a cow-skin will be able
to embrace.” Mahdi, having agreed to the bargain,
our Sâid made the cow-skin into thin stripes,
which he joined together and surrounded the whole
fort. He then wrote an order to the Ráis Mazafer,
who held a command at the foot of the mountains
of Dámâan, and was a follower of his doctrine, to
that effect: “The Ráis Mazafer (may God Almighty
guard him!) shall pay to Alí Mahdî three thousand
dinars, as the price of the fort Almút. Blessing
upon the prophet and his descendants; God suffices
to us, and it is good to trust our interests
to him.”</p>

<p>Having written this, he delivered it to Mahdi,
and brought him out of the fort. The latter, some
time after, pressed by indigence, presented the writ
<a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a><span class="pageno">435</span>
to the Râis Mazafer, and received three thousand
dinars in gold.</p>

<p>Thus at last the affairs of our Sáid were carried,
after many difficulties, to the possession of the castle
Almút, and in a short time the whole country of
Rúdbár and Kohistan fell into his fortunate hands;
within thirty and six years, he rose to great prosperity
and power. After him seven of his followers
held the government, and the duration of the prosperity
of this sect was eighty and one years.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_643" id="fnanchor_643"></a><a href="#footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></span>
Our
Sáid strove at perfection of rectitude and piety, and
the zeal of this lord in upholding the law was carried
to such a degree, that he drove out of the fort
an individual who played the flute, and in spite of
the intercessions of many persons in his favor,
never gave him entrance again. During the time of
his government, he went no more than twice to sit
upon the terrace of his house, and never was seen
out of the fort, always occupied with the direction of
the affairs of the state and of religion. In his time
the fedáyís (his devoted followers) destroyed a great
number of the great and noble adversaries of his
sect.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_644" id="fnanchor_644"></a><a href="#footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></span>
At last death transported our Sáid from
<a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a><span class="pageno">436</span>
this world of vexations to the gardens of paradise,
in the fourth month of the year (September, the
beginning of autumn) of the Hejira 518<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_645" id="fnanchor_645"></a><a href="#footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></span>
(A. D.
1124-5).</p>

<p>His appointed successor was <span class="person">Kia Buzerk umíd</span>.</p>

<p>As <span class="person">Hussáin Fáni</span>, one of the trusty companions
of our Sáid,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_646" id="fnanchor_646"></a><a href="#footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></span>
with a troop of refîks (followers)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_647" id="fnanchor_647"></a><a href="#footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></span>
brought Kohistán into his possession, one of the
Umrás of Malikshah, who was in Rúdbár, besieged
several times the fort Almút, and spread slaughter
and devastation about, in such a manner that
the situation of the inhabitants of that castle having
become distressing, they desired to retire into
the valley. Our Sáid, exhorting them to patience
and perseverance, declared that the Imám, namely
Montaśer, had said, the Almutian ought not to
desert the place, which should become to them
the seat of good fortune. At this very time, that
person, their enemy, passed to the other world,
and our Sáid was liberated of all anxiety: on which
<a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a><span class="pageno">437</span>
account the fort was named <dfn>Buldet-ul ikbál</dfn>, “the
town of good fortune.”</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year of the Hejira 485
(A. D. 1092), the Amír Arslán sháh<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_648" id="fnanchor_648"></a><a href="#footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></span>
moved, by order
of the Sultan Maliksháh, the army against Buldet-ul
ikbal. As the situation of the inhabitants of the
fort became desperate,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_649" id="fnanchor_649"></a><a href="#footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></span>
Abu Alí, who was one of the
adherents of our Sáid, and resided in Kazvîn, sent
them three hundred valiant men; and this robust
body threw themselves by night into the fort, from
whence, making a night sally upon the Arslánían,
they routed them, and carried off an immense booty.</p>

<p>When the fugitives arrived in the camp of the
Sultan, he sent <span class="person">Kazil Sarúk</span>, with a strong army to
reduce the rebels <span class="place">in Khorasan</span>. Hassáín Fáni, <em>one
of Hassan’s chiefs</em>, having taken refuge with his rafíks
in <span class="place">Múmin-ábád</span>, the general of the Sultan made the
necessary preparations for a siege. When he was
upon the point of seizing the splendid conquest,
the intelligence suddenly spread of the murder of
Khájah Nizam al mulk by the hand of <span class="person">Abu Táher
Adáni</span>, who was one of the fedáyis of our Sâid; and
closely to this followed the report of the death of
Maliksháh; on which account this army dispersed,
and as the dissension between Barkíarok and the
Sultan Muhammed <span class="person">sons of Malikshah</span>, occasioned
<a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a><span class="pageno">438</span>
their weakness,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_650" id="fnanchor_650"></a><a href="#footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></span>
the strength of the Ismâílíah was
<a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a><span class="pageno">439</span>
increased, and the forts <span class="place">Girdkoh</span> and <span class="place">Lámíser</span> fell into
the possession of our Sáid.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_651" id="fnanchor_651"></a><a href="#footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time the fedáyis, in order to destroy the
learned men and theologians, who entertained a
hatred towards the chosen Ismâílíah, and reviled
their creed, were dispersed on all sides, and brought
a great number of this class beneath the blows of
their swords and poniards: on which account the
learned men and the theologians of the adversaries
were frightened.</p>

<p>When Sultan Barkíárok, the son of Malik shah,
died, Sultan Muhammed Doulet<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_652" id="fnanchor_652"></a><a href="#footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></span>
succeeded to his
sovereignty. The latter sent Ahmed, the son of
Nizam ul Mulk, with an army to the country of
Rúdbár. In the beginning of the year of the Hejira
511<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_653" id="fnanchor_653"></a><a href="#footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></span>
(A. D. 1117) he despatched Alabet Tóshacín
shërgír<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_654" id="fnanchor_654"></a><a href="#footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></span>
to the assistance of the Vizir; nearly a year
had elapsed when they were about to take the fort
<a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a><span class="pageno">440</span>
Buldet ul ikbál; at that time the intelligence of the
death of Sultan Muhammed was spread in Atabec’s
camp: on which account that army took to flight in
the night time.</p>

<p>When Sultan Sinjar<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_655" id="fnanchor_655"></a><a href="#footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></span>
had placed the crown of
sovereignty upon his head, he sent forces several
times to combat the sect of the Ismâílíah. At
that time our Sáid Hassan enjoined to one of the
Sultan’s servants, who had adopted the creed of the
Ismâílíah: “Fix a dagger in the ground near the
Sultan’s head; but do him no harm, because thou
art nourished by his salt, and it is not right to
lay the hand on the master.” The servant did
so. When Sinjar awoke from sleep, he saw the
dagger, and was very much frightened, but kept
this occurrence concealed.</p>

<p>Some days after, the ambassador of our Sáid came
to visit him, and said: “If we did not entertain
friendship for the Sultan, that dagger, which in
such a night was fixed in the hard ground, would
have been buried in the soft bosom of the Sultan.”
After having heard this, the Sultan’s apprehension
<a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a><span class="pageno">441</span>
increased, and he made peace;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_656" id="fnanchor_656"></a><a href="#footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></span>
wherefore the state
of Hassan’s affairs gained strength.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Hossâín Fány<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_657" id="fnanchor_657"></a><a href="#footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></span>
became a martyr,
by the iniquity of <dfn>the Ostad</dfn>, “doctor” Hossáín,
the son of Hassan, the son of Sabah; our Sáid
ordered, that he should be put to death by the law
of retaliation. About this time, another son of Hassan
was found addicted to drinking wine; by order
of his celebrated father, soon after his brother, he
drank the cup of death.</p>

<p>Our Sáid, having fallen sick in the year of the
Hejira 518<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_658" id="fnanchor_658"></a><a href="#footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></span>
(A. D. 1124-5), he appointed <span class="person">Kia buzerg
Umid</span> his successor, and committed the dignity of
his vizirate to <span class="person">Abu Alí</span>; he enjoined these two persons
that, in all transactions they should not deviate from
the direction given them by Hossan Fakrání,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_659" id="fnanchor_659"></a><a href="#footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></span>
and
<a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a><span class="pageno">442</span>
having thus settled these affairs, on the twenty-eighth
day of the last Rabiâ (the fourth month) of
the said year, he emigrated to the gardens of
Paradise.</p>

<p>Kíá Buzurg Umid, who was originally from the
country of Rúdbár, tended, according to the precept
of our Sáid, towards devotion and the strengthening
of religion.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_660" id="fnanchor_660"></a><a href="#footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></span></p>

<p>After him, Muhammed Buzerg Umíd took the
government. In the beginning of his reign <span class="person">Alráshid
billah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_661" id="fnanchor_661"></a><a href="#footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></span>
was killed by a band of fedáyís, and from
this time, fearing the swords of the Almútían, the
khalifs concealed themselves. Muhammed Buzerg
also followed the example of Hassan.</p>

<p>After him came Muhammed, the son of Hassan,
the son of Muhammed, who is known under the
name <span class="title">Alí zikrihi-al-sálam</span>, which means “let peace
be upon him.” Concerning Hossan there are
many tales. His adversaries assert, that he was the
<a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a><span class="pageno">443</span>
son of Muhammed Umíd, and a class of the Ismâílíah
of Rúdbár and Kohistan said that, in the time
of the reign of our Sáid, one year after the death of
Mont´aser the High, a person called Abul Hassan
Sayidí, who had been in the particular confidence of
the khalif, came from Egypt to Almut, and brought
with him a boy descended from Nazár, the son of
Montaśer, to whom the Imámate belonged, and
nobody was informed of this secret except our Sáid,
that is, Hassan, who treated Abul Hassan with regard
and respect, and made the Imám reside in a
village at the foot of Almút. After a delay of six
months, he gave Abul Hassan leave to depart. The
Imám was inclined to the worship of God and to
retirement, and united himself in wedlock with a
modest woman in the village. When she became
pregnant, he committed her to Muhammed, the son
of Buzerg Umíd, and recommended secresy in that
affair, saying: “When a boy comes to light, take
the woman.” Muhammed acted according to the
injunction, and during the reign of Muhammed, son
of Buzerg Umíd, the belief in the appearance of a son,
identified with Alí zikrichi-al salam, gained the way
of splendor, and the report was this&mdash;that he was
the son of Muhammed. Many asserted that whatever
deed and action emanates from the Imám is not
only lawful but laudable. The son of Nazar, whom
Abul Hassan Sâyídí had brought to Almút, when
<a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a><span class="pageno">444</span>
arrived at the age of virility, had connexion with the
lawful wife of Muhammed, the son of Buzerg Umíd,
and Ali zikrichi al salam was the fruit of it. Although,
because proceeding from a prophet and
Imám, this action be legal, yet it was not necessary.
The relation between Alî zikrichi al salam and Montaśer
Billah is derived from this cause. The Ismâílíah
acknowledge as a legitimate Imám the victorious
by the power of God, Hassan, the son of Mahdi,
the son of Ilhádi, the son of Nazár, the son of Montas&nbsp;ar.
They call his precious spirit “the resurrection;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_662" id="fnanchor_662"></a><a href="#footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></span>
because they believe that the resurection
takes place at the lord’s time, when men join
God, and when the inconveniences of the law are
taken off; this meaning is expressed by “resurrection;”
and that the lord, at the time of his Imámate,
having united the creatures with the Creator,
threw off the observances of the law.</p>

<p>It is reported that, when this lord placed his foot
upon the cushion of the khiláfet, in the year of the
Hejira 559 (A. D. 1163-4), he convoked all the chiefs
and nobles of his dominion in Buldet ul ikbál, and
ordered that, in the meeting-place of that fortunate
fort, a pulpit should be placed towards the Kiblah,
<a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a><span class="pageno">445</span>
and four flags, one red, another green, the third
yellow, and the fourth white, should be fixed in
the four corners of the pulpit. On the seventeenth
day of the blessed Ramzan of the said year,
he ascended the pulpit, and unfolding the tongue
of prodigious speeches, he said: “I am the Imám
of the age; and I took off the hardship of the
ordinances and prohibitions from the inhabitants
of the world, and I held the commands of
the law for nothing; now is the period of the
lord of the resurrection; the creatures are to
be bound by ties of love to God, and enjoy the
external things in whatever manner they like.”
He then descended from the top of the pulpit, and,
having broken fast, ordered that, in the manner
of a festival, all should occupy themselves with
mirth and cheerfulness, and playing and gaming;
and this fortunate day was entitled “the festival
of resurrection,” and made the beginning of a
new era. This is also the day on which, according
to the reckoning of many historians, the lord
<dfn>Amír Almumin Alí</dfn>, “the Amír of the believers,” was
wounded by Abd ul rahmen. As to escape from
this world and to join heaven is the object of enjoyment
of perfect spirits, so do they on this day
chiefly devote themselves to pleasure. The creed
of this lord was, that the world is ancient, and
time infinite; that the other world is spiritual, and
<a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a><span class="pageno">446</span>
heaven and hell figurative; that the resurrection is
the particular death of every one. This lord was
stabbed with a dagger in the month Rubiâ (August) of
the year of the Hejira 561<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_663" id="fnanchor_663"></a><a href="#footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></span>
(A. D. 1165-6) by Hassan,
the son of Namvár, who descended from Bavíah.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_664" id="fnanchor_664"></a><a href="#footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></span>
On account of the last will of his father, he occupied
the Imámate; like his celebrated father, he upheld
the faith.</p>

<p>Jelál eddin, of the same family, made a martyr of
his father by means of poison. As he obtained the
Imámate in an undue manner, and seized the government
by usurpation, he also abandoned the religion
of the Ismâilíah. After eleven years, in the month
<a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a><span class="pageno">447</span>
Ramzan of the year of the Hejirah 618<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_665" id="fnanchor_665"></a><a href="#footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></span>
(A. D.
1221-2) he died of dysentery.</p>

<p>After him, Ala eddin Muhammed, son of Jelál eddin
Hassan, put to death all those who, by orders
of Jelál eddin, had given poison to his grandfather,
and who had also participated in the opinions and
behaviour of Jelál eddin; he conformed himself to
the manners of his ancestors, and denied those of
his father. He let himself be bled without the advice
of a medical man, and as too much blood was taken
from him, he was overcome by melancholy.</p>

<p>The Ismâílíah say, that prophets and saints cannot
live free from bodily defects: thus <span class="person">Músi</span> (Moses)
was a stammerer, <span class="person">Shâyeb</span> (Jethro, father in law of
Moses) was blind, and <span class="person">Ayúb</span> (Job) was full of plagues.
It was in the time of the lord Ala eddin Muhammed,
that Náśer Motashem, who was the lord of Kohistan,
and to whom the book <cite>Akhlák Naśeri</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_666" id="fnanchor_666"></a><a href="#footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></span>
is dedicated,
sent Khájah Náśir to Almút. Hassan Mázinderáni
was contrary to Ismâílism; he made Alá-eddin
a martyr (by killing him). In the time of Ala
eddin there was among the learned men of the
age the shaikh Jamál Gíli: in Kazvin, occupied with
the instruction of the people, he was in secret addicted,
and made proselytes, to the creed of the
<a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a><span class="pageno">448</span>
Ismâílíah; on that account, Alâ-eddin showed him
respect, and conferred favors on the inhabitants of
Kazvin, to whom he said that, if the shaikh did not
live in that place, he would carry the ground of
Kazvin in a beggar’s wallet to Almút; but the learned,
who were not Ismâílíah, did not acknowledge an
Ismâílíah shaikh. In giving an account of his (Ala-eddin’s)
death it was said:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“The ornament of faith and religion, the polar-star of the elect of God,</div>
 <div class="i0"> He whose threshold was the Kiblah of hopes,</div>
 <div class="i0">In the year six hundred and fifty-one<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_667" id="fnanchor_667"></a><a href="#footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></span>
    (A. D. 1253) he went to the Lord,</div>
 <div class="i0">At night, on Monday, on the fourth day of Shavál (the tenth Arabian month).”</div>
</div>

<p>After Alá-eddin Muhammed, it was Rukn-eddin
Khúrshah who became king in Almút. He put to
death Hassan Mazinderání with his family, and
burnt their corpses.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_668" id="fnanchor_668"></a><a href="#footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></span></p>

<p>Holagú khan<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_669" id="fnanchor_669"></a><a href="#footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></span>
overcame Rocn-eddin: the latter
<a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a><span class="pageno">449</span>
demanded to be sent to the court of Maikú khán,
which demand was granted; on the journey he
<a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a><span class="pageno">450</span>
attained the extremity of his life; his reign did not
last one year.</p>

<p>In Almút had been dug several reservoirs which
were filled with vinegar, honey, and wine; these
<a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a><span class="pageno">451</span>
things and all stores, which had been deposited in
the time of our Sáíd, that is, of Hassan Śabáh, were
found without any alteration: all were astonished,
and the Ismâílíah thought this event to be one of
the miracles of their Said.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center small">AN ACCOUNT OF THE ALI ILAHÍAN.</p>

<p>In the east of Kohistan, not far from Bakhtá, is a
place called <span class="place">Arníl</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_670" id="fnanchor_670"></a><a href="#footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></span>
and also <span class="place">Armal</span>; the king is there
<a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a><span class="pageno">452</span>
entitled <span class="title">Abáb</span>. They say: as it is evident to the
swimmer in the sea of the realities of events, that
the door of intercourse is closed between the beings
below and those above, and no intercourse is opened
between the elemental and the heavenly beings, so
are the temporal beings and those of eternity destitute
of the bonds of relationship, and no connexion
exists between those confined, and those unconfined,
by space; therefore they are ordered to know God
by investigation of wisdom and of the divine law, and
to worship the divinity. The angels on high and
the prophets below have the faculty of knowing the
substance of the blessed verses, but not the divine
Being itself:</p>

<p class="center small">“We do not know thee as thou shouldst be known.”</p>

<p>This is what the crier proclaims. On that account
it is necessary to the Almighty God and eternal
Lord that he should descend from the dignity
of purity and from the station of unity and absoluteness,
and that, according to the abundance of his
clemency, he should, in every period and revolution
of time, unite his spirit with a bodily frame,
in order that his creatures may behold this holy and
exalted Lord, and, in whatever manner he ordains,
acknowledge and reverence him; the precepts and
<a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a><span class="pageno">453</span>
traditions of history are published to that effect.
As the manifestation of a spirit in a bodily form is a
possible fact, and the learned agree upon it, and as
it is stated in the account of the travellers upon the
road of salvation to the city of the true faith, so is it
determined that a pure spirit may assume a bodily
likeness; thus is the appearance of Jabrîl in the form
of an ape-dog<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_671" id="fnanchor_671"></a><a href="#footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></span>
an instance of it, and thus, on the
occasions of wickedness, is the appearance of Satan,
or a demon in a human form. Besides, it is in the
power of the Almighty to manifest himself in the
best, the most perfect body.</p>

<p>The individuals among men are, during the
business of life, formed dependent on their mutual
wants. To this sect it is an indispensable rule to
associate all together, in order that no oppression
may take place towards each other in their communities,
and that the order of the world may remain
upheld. It is indispensable that this great rule be
<a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a><span class="pageno">454</span>
derived from God, the Lord of glory, in order that
all men may adopt it. On that account, the government
of the supreme Judge has found necessary that,
by power of his perfection, a canon, having been
revealed among the different classes of mankind,
should be agreed upon for the regulation of the
creatures, in consequence of which the purpose of
the conditions in the affairs of the world might be
settled. Further, by the assistance of reason and
instruction, there is in this age no other moon or sun
in the sphere of perfection but ALI MURTAZA,
“the chosen.” Truly, the <em>illiterate prophet</em><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_672" id="fnanchor_672"></a><a href="#footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></span>
(Muhammed)
<a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a><span class="pageno">455</span>
esteemed this blessed personage equal to several
learned apostles, and saw praiseworthy qualities
of a prophet united in that virtuous existence.
Hence it follows, that men possessed of sight behold
him sometimes come down from heaven in the shape
of the father of mankind (<span class="title">Adam</span>), and reckon his
time to be that of one who inhabited the floating
ship of Noah, and place him as far back as that age
when a martyr, in the garment of Ibrahim, he was
playing with the fire <em>into which Nimrod had thrown
him</em>; another time they find him in the dress of the
speaker with God, <em>Moses</em>, and the words of that Lord:</p>

<p class="center small">“He who knows himself, certainly knows God,”</p>

<p class="unindent">confirm that the pure spirit of that embodied soul,
and wisdom, represented in a person, is the Creator
of the world, worthy of praise. And the sentence:</p>

<p class="center small">“God created man according to his image,”</p>

<p class="unindent">relates to the same, as Adam, the holy father of
mankind, the Just, is nobody else but <span class="title">Alí Murtazi</span>.
And the saying:</p>

<p class="center small">“I saw the Lord in the shape of a man,”</p>

<p class="unindent">refers to that eternal being, merging into a body,
as he has manifested himself in the prophet’s visible
<a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a><span class="pageno">456</span>
form under the <a name="shape" id="shape"></a>shape a powerful man; and the
honor of the prophet’s presenting his shoulder by
the assistance of the divine grace to the foot of that
leader, relates but to this, that reverence is due to
him, as that truth-speaking and truth-singing poet
sung:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="i0b">“The prophet, in breaking down the idols, had no other desire</div>
 <div class="i0">But that his shoulder might be placed beneath the foot of the chosen;</div>
 <div class="i0">And the house of the worshipped Kâbah be filled with his presence.”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_673" id="fnanchor_673"></a><a href="#footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></span>These sectaries also say, that in every revolution
of time, the Lord God was united to the body of a
prophet or saint, namely, from Adam down to Ahmed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_674" id="fnanchor_674"></a><a href="#footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></span>
and Alí, in which manner they explain the
transmigration of the divine light. And some of
them say, that the manifestation of God in this age
<a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a><span class="pageno">457</span>
took place in Aly alah, and after him in his descendants,
and they acknowledge Muhammed and Alí
as prophets and the mission of Alí alah. They
assert, that when God saw that the business did not
go on well by the prophet, he came to his assistance,
as it were, by way of zeal. The author of this book
saw a person from among them, called Ahmed, who
said, that the Koran which is among them does not
deserve confidence, as it is not the book which Alí
Alah had given to Muhammed; but is the composition
of Abu bekr, of Omar, and Osman. The author
saw also one named Shams-eddin, who said: Certainly
the Koran is the word of Alí alah, but having
been collected by Osman, it ought not to be read.
Some were seen among them who asserted that the
verse and prose, ascribed to the Amir of the believers,
<span class="person">Omar</span>, were collected by Alí, and inserted in
the Koran, and to these they attach a superiority
over the Koran, inasmuch as they came from Alí
allah to the creatures without foreign intervention,
whilst the Farkan, <span class="title">Koran</span>, was delivered into the
hands of men by means of Muhammed.</p>

<p>There is besides a sect among them which is
called the <span class="title">Ulvíahs</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_675" id="fnanchor_675"></a><a href="#footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></span>
They themselves derive their
origin from Alí allah, and in their creed participate
<a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a><span class="pageno">458</span>
with that of the just mentioned sect: they say, that
the Koran which is now among men, is not the
word of Alí allah, because the shaiks (Abu bekr and
Omar) employed themselves in its transposition, and
at last Osman cast the whole away; as he possessed
eloquence, he composed a book in his own way,
and burnt the original Koran, wherefore these sectaries,
wherever they find this book, consign it to
the flames. Their belief is, that when Alí allah left
the body, he was united with the sun; that he is
now the sun; and having also been the sun before,
he was for some days joined to an elemental body.
They further maintain, that on this account the sun
was moving by his order, inasmuch as he is the real
sun; wherefore they call the sun <dfn>Alí allah</dfn>, and the
fourth heaven <dfn>Daldal</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_676" id="fnanchor_676"></a><a href="#footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></span>
They are worshippers of the
sun, whom they hold to be God Almighty. They
are a respectable tribe, and a division of them pretend
that they can call upon the sun, who answers
them, and affords them protection in their affairs.</p>

<p>Abd ullah, one of them so named, reported, that
among his relations was a man called Azíz, upon
whom, when he pronounced with fervour Alí
allah, and gave himself up to an ecstatical song or
dance, no sword could take effect. Thus, when
<a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a><span class="pageno">459</span>
one of the incredulous denied this, Azíz became
warm, and took to calling out “Alí allah” in such
a manner that foam settled upon his lips, and he
cried to the denier: “Strike, O accursed!” The
latter aimed several blows with a sword at him, but
effected nothing. This person has now joined Alí
allah in the other world.</p>

<p>Among these sectaries it is not permitted to kill
any living being, nor to eat any flesh, as Alí allah
said:</p>

<p class="center small">“Make not of your bellies the tombs of living beings.”</p>

<p>And the animals which the Koran permits to be
killed, and the flesh which he allows to be eaten, is
that of Abu bekr, of Omar, and Osman, and of their
followers, and all prohibited things, they say, have
reference to these three persons. With them, Iblis,
the serpent, and the peacock are symbols of these
three, and likewise Shedád,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_677" id="fnanchor_677"></a><a href="#footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></span>
Nimród, and Phárâún
are they. These sectaries admit prostration before
the image of Alí allah; the breaking and worshipping
of idols relates, according to them, to the said
three individuals, as Alí allah called the Shaikhs the
<a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a><span class="pageno">460</span>
idols of the Korêsh. They agree upon transmigration,
and say, that when Alí appeared in former
times in the form of a prophet, those three also
made their appearance in the shape of deniers, and
after them many others will come.</p>

 The Zaydíyat derive their name from <span class="person">Záíd</span>, son of Alí, son of Záín
el-abeddin. They are subdivided into three branches, according to others
into five, under as many chiefs. I shall only mention three. The first,
the <span class="title">Jarudíyat</span>, think that the Imámate was destined by the prophet to
Alí, but that after the two sons of the latter, Hasan and Hosain, the
sacred office was uncertain in their children, and that those only who
rose, sword in hand, were Imáms; they do not agree upon the last Imám,
still expected. The second branch, the <span class="title">Salaimaniyat</span>, admit the right
of Abubekr and Omar to the Imámate, but declare as infidels Osman,
Zobeir, and Aisha. The third branch, the <span class="title">Báíteriyat</span>, are for the most
part in accordance with the second, as to what regards Osman. These
three branches are heretics in the dogmas only, but, in jurisprudence,
they follow almost all the orthodox doctrine of Abú Hanifáh.&mdash;(See

 The Orientals attribute more than sixty-five treatises to Plato. They
relate that, being asked what he thought of this world, he answered:
“I entered into it by necessity; I dwelt in it with admiration; and I
leave it with contempt.” Al Ghazali (before-mentioned, see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 349,

 The author mentions three sciences, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">فان قلام</span> <dfn>fán kalám</dfn>,
“the science of scholastic theology;” <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">فن اصول فقہِ</span> <dfn>fán ás ul fikah</dfn>,
“the science of the fundamentals of religion and law;” and <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">فن فِقہ</span>
<dfn>fan fikah</dfn>, “jurisprudence.” We have already explained the first (see
<a href="#footnote_506">note 1</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 327); the four fundamental articles of the faith have been also
enumerated (see <a href="#footnote_500">note 1</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 324); but the <dfn>fikah</dfn>, “jurisprudence,” although
stated as distinct, in reality comprehends the two first, and in addition
shows only the practical application of them. Al Ghazali, quoted by Pococke
(<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 200-201, etc., 1st <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr>), after having said that this world is created for
furnishing assistance on the way to future life, in order that men, with a
due check on cupidity, may take as much of this world as may be sufficient
for a viaticum, and after having declared, that the jurist is to be the
director of the king in the mode of retaining the people in due order,
subjoins: “This science (the law) belongs to religion, although not by
itself, yet by the intervention of the world. For the world is a field
which is sown for the future, nor is religion put into practice, if not by
the world. But religion and government are twin-brothers; religion
is the foundation, and the king the guardian; but what wants a foundation,
verges to ruin, and what has no guardian, goes off into nothing,
etc., etc.” The same intimate junction of religion and civil law,
which is acknowledged to prevail in the legislation of the Hindus, as well
as in that of the ancient Hebrews and Persians, has passed into that of
the Muhammedans. Just as the Vedas with the first, the five books of
Moses with the second, the writings of Zoroaster with the third, so is the
Koran with the fourth, the foundation of their code, and contains what we
may call their whole civil and canonical law. With respect to the last-mentioned
book, as it contains likewise all the articles of faith, it follows,
that a doctor in law is also a doctor in theology; or a <dfn>faki</dfn> is at the same
time a lawyer and a theologian: hence the word <dfn>al faqui</dfn> in the language
of the Spaniards, who have preserved to our days, in their character and
manners, not a little of their former conquerors, the Saracens.</p>

 We have (see <a href="#footnote_551">note 1</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 367. 368) given the names of the twelve Imáms.
The tenth, Alí, born in the year of the Hejira 212, A. D. 827, being kept a
close prisoner all his life in the city of <span class="place">Askar</span>, called also <span class="place">Sermenrai</span>, in
Syria, he devoted himself to study and religious exercises, but did not
succeed in calming the jealousy of the ruling khalif, an Abbaside of the
family of Motavakel, the mortal enemy of the whole race of Alí, and was
poisoned in 868 A. D.</p>

<p class="footnote">The name “Askerite,” from the city of Askar, was also given to his
son Hasan, above-mentioned, the eleventh Imám, whose son, Muhammed,
born in 868 A. D., also called Abu ’l Cassem, as the prophet Muhammed,
was the last of the twelve Imáms. He is distinguished by the
surnames <dfn>Mantazar</dfn>, “the expected;” <dfn>Kayim</dfn>, “the stable;” <dfn>Mahdi</dfn>,
“the director, guide;” and others. The followers of this Imám say,
that in his ninth year he was concealed by his mother in a cell or grot,
from which he had not returned in the year 899 A. D.&mdash;(See <cite>Abulfeda</cite>,
<cite>Hist. Moslem.</cite>, <abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 223.) The Sonnites say that he was drowned
in the Tigris in 879 A. D. Some Shiâhs maintain, he died in 941, in his
seventy-fifth year; other Shiâhs pretend that he is still living in the
grot where he was concealed; and all agree in the belief that he will
reappear in the world, immediately before the second coming of the
Messiah, for uniting all the Muselman sects into one, and all the different
religions in Muhammedism. Several impostors assumed the name
of <span class="title">Mahdi</span>, but in vain; nevertheless, two great dynasties were founded
under that name, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: the <span class="title">Almohads</span> and <span class="title">Fatemites</span>.&mdash;(<cite>Herbelot.</cite>)</p>

 According to the Shiâhs, Mahdi made two retreats or eclipses, the
great and the minor. The minor was that, during which he now and then
gave news of himself, and decided all the questions which the Muselmans
proposed, by means of certain messengers who carried them to him
very secretly, succeeding each other without knowing each other. This
intercourse lasted until the year of the Hejira 326, A. D. 937, in which
year one of these messengers, called <span class="title">Alí</span>, died, after having brought a
letter from Mahdi, by which this Imám announced to him that he (Alí)
would die in six days, and forbade him to leave the commission of visiting
him to any other person. It is from this time that begins “the great
retreat or absence” of Mahdi: for, after the death of this Alí, no
information was received concerning the Mahdi, if not by revelation. This
statement, found in Herbelot, is confirmed by that above.</p>

of the reign of Mâtemed and the end of that of Rási, is seventy-one years,
differing by two from the period above stated; the minor absence might

 Hassan al Baśri was the son of an affranchised man, called Mulla
Zaid ben Tabeth, and of a slave woman, belonging to Omm Salmath, one
of Muhammed the prophet’s wives. Hassan acquired the reputation of
the first scholastic theologian among the Muselmans. He is surnamed
al Baśri, because his father was a slave in Maissan, a borough of the
dependencies of Baśra, or Bassora, and because he kept his school in
that town, where different sectaries often came to dispute with him.
Wassel Eben Ata, his disciple, deviating from his opinions, became the
chief of the Mâtazalahs (see <a href="#footnote_504">note 1</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 325). Hassan al Baśri had seen the
khalif Osman, and Eben Abbas; on that account he quotes in his works
what he had learned from them. He died in the year of the Hejira 110,
A. D. 728, and left a work entitled <cite>Hadis sherif</cite>, containing a collection
of the traditions which he knew relatively to each of the fifty-four <dfn>feridhat</dfn>,
or “obligatory precepts,” of the Muselman law.</p>

 <span class="title">Karkh</span> is the name of a part of the town of Baghdad upon the western
side of the Tigris, where the khalif Mansúr built the town and his palace;

by Shiâhs, who had frequent quarrels with the Sonnites, dwelling in the
other part of the town. One of the most serious tumults between the
two parties took place under the khalif Mostasem. Karkh is the actual
suburb of Baghdad, in which the tombs of Zobeidah, wife of Harun

 The Arabs divide in general the history of philosophy into two great
periods: the first comprises the <dfn>ancient philosophers</dfn>, who are subdivided

According to him, the Motkalemins professed the creation from nothing;
they disputed about the reality or non-reality of general notions; they
endeavoured to adapt philosophy to the dogmas of the Koran; in short,
they were the philosophic theologians of the orthodox sects, or dogmatic
philosophers.</p>

 It is meant probably “two points of view,” and the passage above
relates to the 219th verse of the <abbr title="Second">IInd</abbr> chapter of the Koran, which is as
follows: “They will ask thee concerning wine, and lots; answer: In

their sinfulness is greater than their use.” And again, the 67th verse
of the <abbr title="Sixteenth">XVIth</abbr> sura: “And of the fruits of palm-trees and grapes ye
obtain inebriating drink, and also good nourishment.” Yet the verses
92 and 93 of the <abbr title="Fifth">Vth</abbr> sura are decidedly against wine, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: “O true
believers, surely wine, and lots, and images, and divining arrows, are
an abomination of the work of Satan; therefore avoid them, that you
may prosper.”&mdash;93. “Satan seeketh to sow discussion and hatred
among you, by means of wine and lots, and to divert you from remembering
God, and from prayer; will ye not, therefore, abstain from
them?”&mdash;(<cite>Sale’s translation.</cite>)</p>

 <span class="person">Jâfer</span>, surnamed <span class="person">S&nbsp;adik</span>, “the Just,” was the eldest son of Muhammed
Baker, the fifth Imám. Jâfer was born in Medina, in the year of the
Hejira 83, A. D. 702; he is acknowledged the síxth Imám, and of great
authority in religious matters among the Muselmans. He died in his
native town, under the khalifate of Abú Jâfer Almansor, the second
khalif of the Abbasides, in the year of the Hejira 148, A. D. 764, in his
sixty-second year.</p>

<p class="footnote">The two eldest of his seven sons were Ismâil and Mussa. Ismâil, the
elder of the two, having died during his father’s life, the latter appointed
Mussa his successor, which gave rise to the contest above mentioned,
and to several sects, as well as to two great dynasties. The Fatimite
khalifs in Egypt are considered as descendants of the branch of Ismáil,
called Ismâilahs, of Africa, but the Suffavean monarchs of Asia claim to
derive their origin from Mussa, and strenuously support his title to the

 All those who believe that the Imamate passed legitimately from

above-mentioned, surnamed <dfn>Mectúm</dfn>, “the concealed,” succeeded his

 The number <em>seven</em> acts a great part in the system of the Ismâilahs.
All things, after having attained the septenary number, are at their end,
must undergo a change, and be succeeded by other things. To the septenaries
above mentioned, I shall add seven palms, of which the height
of a man is said to consist, seven climates, and seven seas, according to
the Koran (Sura <abbr title="31 verse">XXXI. v.</abbr> 26): “If all the trees on the earth were pens,
and God should after that swell the sea into seven seas of ink, the
words of God would not be exhausted.” We know how generally in

 “The Batenian, ‘interior,’” says Silvestre de Sacy, “are so called,
because they establish an interior sense of the Scripture besides the
exterior; they say, whoever attaches himself to the exterior, fatigues
himself with vain practices, whilst he, who follows tho interior, may
dispense with all actions; they give to faith a preference over Islamism,
undoubtedly,” founded upon the authority of the Koran, where it
“is to be found” (Sura <abbr title="49 verse">XLIX. v.</abbr> 14): “The Arabs of the desert say:
‘We believe;’ answer: ‘Ye do by no means believe; but say: ‘We
have embraced Islam;’ for the faith hath not yet entered into your
hearts.’”</p>

<p class="footnote">The Ismâilahs are often confounded with the Batenian. The first who
maintained this doctrine of mystic interpretation was Marzaban, ben
Abdullah, ben Maimun al Kadah. He was the servant of Imám Jâfer
Sadík, and also served Jâfer’s son Ismâil, after whose death he attended
Muhammed, the son of the latter. When Jâfer was poisoned, Abdullah
carried off Jâfer’s grandson, from Medina to Misr (Egypt). When Muhammed
died, he left a concubine pregnant, and Abdullah, having put
her to death, substituted a woman of his own in her room. This woman
brought forth a son, whom Abdullah asserted to be Muhammed’s son;
and when this son had grown up, he succeeded in making him acknowledged
as the Imám by many. Some of this person’s descendants attained
the rank of sovereigns, and the doctrine of the Batenian spread afar.
The first of these who sat on the throne of the khalifat was Sáid, under
the name of Abu-Muhammed Obaid-alla, the founder of the Fatimite
khalifs, in Africa, in the year of the Hejira 296, A. D. 908. He took the
title of <dfn>Al Mahdi</dfn>, “the Director.”&mdash;(See, upon this sect, <cite>Asiatic Researches</cite>,

<p class="footnote">The Fatimites claim their descent from <span class="person">Alí</span>, the fourth legitimate
khalif, and from <span class="person">Fatima</span>, the daughter of the prophet; but their adversaries

 “There are twenty-nine chapters of the Koran, which have this

believe to be the peculiar marks of the Koran, and to conceal several
profound mysteries; the certain understanding of which the more
intelligent confess, has not been communicated to any mortal, their
prophet only excepted. Notwithstanding which, some will take the
liberty of guessing at their meaning, by that species of <span class="title">cabala</span> called
by the Jews <span class="title">Notarikon</span>, and suppose the letters to stand for as many
words, expressing the names and attributes of God, his works, ordinances,
and decrees: and therefore these mysterious letters, as well as
the verses themselves, seem in the Koran to be called <span class="title">signs</span>. Others
explain the intent of these letters from their nature or organ, or else

<p class="footnote">The above account of the proceeding by which the Ismâilahs made
proselytes to their creed exhibits one of the most insidious systems that
has ever been invented to ensnare men. Silvestre de Sacy, in the Memoir
quoted, <a href="#footnote_603">note 2</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 405, enumerates nine degrees of initiation by which a
neophyte, under the direction of a <dfn>Dâí</dfn>, or “teacher,” was to pass, to
be made a perfect Ismâilah. The first degree is to perplex the disciple
by difficult questions; the second degree is to fix that the Imáms only
have received the divine mission to instruct Muselmans; the third, establishes
the series of seven Imáms, beginning at Alí and terminating at
Ismâil, son of Jâfer; the fourth makes known the seven periods of prophets
(as shown in note 1, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 407); the fifth, conducts to contempt of the
traditions and of the literal sense of the Koran, and is connected with
some principles of philosophy and mathematics, or rather with fantastic
notions on the power of particular numbers, such as seven, twelve, etc.,
applied to some phenomena of nature; the sixth degree imposes an entire
submission to the Imám, and reveals that all legal and religious ordinances
are nothing else but political contrivances, for keeping the vulgar
in necessary dependence and subordination. At this degree the initiation
stops for the greatest number of the candidates, and even of the Dáis.
The seventh degree shows two principles in the organization of the universe:
the one gives, the other receives; the one male, the other female:
thus is duality substituted for the unity of the Divine nature; the eighth
degree is consecrated to the development of the above mentioned notions;
two beings are supposed to exist: the one <dfn>sabik</dfn>, “the antecedent;” the
other, <dfn>larik</dfn>, “the subsequent.” Some of the Ismâilahs, however, admit
a being not to be defined, without name and attributes, above the “antecedent.”
To this degree is subjoined the dogma of a possible ascension,
from the undermost stage of hierarchy to the highest being, by an
endless series of periods and revolutions; a new religion is established
upon the ruins of the former; the resurrection, the end of the world, the
last judgment, the rewards and punishments, are only emblematic expressions
of the successive periodical revolutions of the stars and of the universe,
of the destruction and renovation of all beings, produced by the
disposition and combination of the elements. Arrived at the ninth degree,
the proselyte knows of no religion, nor submission to any other authority
but his own, and is left to himself for choosing among the systems of
philosophy the one he likes best.</p>

 The Kâbah of Mecca has been several times mentioned. The building
of this temple is traced back by the devotees to Adam and his son
Seth; after its destruction by the universal deluge, it was constructed by
Abraham and his son Ismâil. We may believe that a sacred building
existed at Mecca long before Muhammed, during the prevalence of the
Sabean religion: it is held to have been the temple of Saturn. After
Muhammed it was renewed by Ebn Zobair, and finally made such as it
is by Hejaz, in the year of the Hejira 74, A. D. 693.&mdash;(See Pococke,

 The pilgrims, who crowd to Mecca from the most distant countries,
think to sanctify themselves by the performance of a series of rites and
ceremonies, such as their prophet himself, at his last visit to this place,
fixed by his example; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: he purified himself by bathing; he then went
to the eastern gate of the temple; there he kissed the black stone, upon
which Abraham, so the Muhammedans believe, conversed with Agar, to
which he tied his camels, and upon which the traces of his feet are still
seen; further, the prophet made the seven circuits of the Kâbah, running
round it three times, and four times marching with a grave and measured
pace. He afterwards proceeded to the two stones, <span class="title">Sáfá</span> and
<span class="title">Marvah</span>; the first at the foot of mount Abi Kobaisi, the second at that
of Koaikaban, distant 780 cubits from each other. These stones are supposed
to have been once two idols, Asaph and Nayelah; or two persons,
a man and a woman, who, for having committed stupration in the temple,
were changed into stones. At each of them he recited with a loud voice
the (since formulary) praise of God. Finally, having proclaimed his
last revelation, by which he declared his religion to be perfected, he
sacrificed sixty-three camels, one for each year of his then closing age:
he returned to Medina, and soon after died.</p>

 <dfn>Khájah</dfn> signifies “lord, professor, man of distinction” (and also
a eunuch). Khájah is the title commonly prefixed to <dfn>Naśir-eddin</dfn>,
“the defender of the faith,” which is the surname of Muhammed ben
Hassan or Ben Muhammed al Túsi, born in Tús, in the year of the Hejira
597, A. D. 1200. He is acknowledged to have been the doctor who
acquired among Muselmans the highest reputation in all sorts of sciences;
he was a commentator of Euclid, and of the spherics of Theodosius and
Menelaus. He left scientific works, duly admired, and was an astronomer,
lawyer, theologian, and statesman. We shall have to touch upon
the part which he took in the great events of his days. He died in the
year of the Hejira 672, or, according to some, 687 (A. D. 1273 or 1285).</p>

Obaid-alla, Mahdi. The friends and enemies of the Fatemites

“the oculist,” whom some make a descendant of Ali, whilst others
say that he was the son of <dfn>Daísan</dfn>, “the dualist,” so called because he
ascribed the good to God and the evil to man, and some attribute to him
an origin, not only foreign to the race of the prophet, but even connected
with a Magian and Jewish lineage. Obaid-allah made Kairwan
or Kurm (the ancient Cyrene) the capital of his dominion, but at the
same time he laid the foundation of a new capital, which he called <span class="title">Mahedia</span>,
from his assumed surname <span class="title">Mahdi</span>. Abu Tamim Moadd Moezzledin
allah, the fourth in descent from Obaid allah, but the first acknowledged
Fatimite khalif removed his seat to Cairo in Egypt: this town

 Abu Yazid, according to Abulfeda (<cite><abbr title="Annales Moslemica" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annal. Mosl.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 240),
was a barbarian of the tribe of Zenata (one of the Berbers), son of Condad
and an Ethiopian mother. He feigned sanctity, and belonged to a
sect inimical to the Muselmans, whom he persecuted with relentless fury.
Herbelot says, he was a chancellor of Abúl-Kasem Muhammed Kayem,
the second khalif of the Fatimites, who succeeded his father Obaid-alla,
in the year of the Hejira 322 (A. D. 933). Abu Yazid rose in rebellion
against his master, and brought the empire to the greatest peril;
but, after many successes and conquests, he was defeated, taken prisoner,
and died of his wounds, in the year of the Hejira 336 (A. D. 947).</p>

by persons of a contemplative turn of mind. Baron von Hammer (Schöne
Redekünste Persiens, S. 43) adduces Nassir Khosru of Ispahan, who,
famous as a poet and philosopher, was persecuted on account of doubtful
orthodoxy in matters of faith, and who died in the year of the Hejira 431
(A. D. 1039). A sect of Ismâilah is said (<cite><abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="volume Eleven page">vol. XI. p.</abbr> 425) to

 The mention made above of Hassan, and further of the Almutiahs,
points to the reign of Abu Tamim Moâd Mostanser Billah, from the year
of the Hejira 427 to 487, (A. D. 1035 to 1094). At the beginning of
this reign, Amir Naśer Khusro, if the date of his birth be right, would
have been more than sixty-six years old, and twenty years of concealment
in Badakhshan extend his age beyond eighty-six years.</p>

 The author of the Dabistán has given a sufficiently explicit account
of the doctrine of the Ismâilahs, but without separating the opinions
belonging in particular to each of the sects into which the Ismâilahs in
the course of time divided. We have already mentioned the <span class="title">Batenian</span>.
Another division was that of the <span class="title">Karmatians</span>, founded by Hamadan,
surnamed <dfn>Karmata</dfn>, “small and distorted,” son of Ashath. He appeared
first in the year of the Hejira 278 (A. D. 891), as an adherent of Ahmed,
son of Abdallah, son of Maimun Kaddah, before mentioned (<a href="#footnote_617">note 1</a>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 418). This Ahmed was an ancestor of Sáid, or Obaid-allah, the founder
of the Fatimite khalifs. Hamden Karmata recommended community of
women, and released men from all moral and religious duties. In the
year of the Hejira 286 (A. D. 899), Abu Sáid, surnamed Habab, at the
head of the Karmatians, waged war upon the khalif Motadhet, in Syria;
he took the town Hagiar, the Petra deserti of the Romans, once the
capital of Arabia, and made it his residence. He was assassinated in the
year of the Hejira 301 (A. D. 913). He left six sons; after the death of
the last of them, Yusuf (Abu Yakub), in the year 366, (A. D. 976), the
Karmatians confided their government to six seids called <dfn>sadah</dfn>, “pure.”
This sect, after many combats, was dissipated towards the end of the
tenth century of our era.&mdash;(See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Chrestomathie arabe">Chrestom. ar.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 126.)</p>

<p class="footnote">The Ismâilahs are also denominated <span class="title">Talamites</span>, <span class="title">Khurramiah</span>, <span class="title">Safiah</span>,
<span class="title">Babeciah</span>, <span class="title">Majmirah</span>, <span class="title">Maknâyah</span>, etc.&mdash;(<cite><abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="volume Eleven page">vol. XI. p.</abbr> 421, etc.)
I have no room for an account of each of them: I shall only add the name
of the <span class="title">Druses</span>, a sect existing in our days, upon which Silvestre de Sacy
gave a particular notice drawn from their own papers, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chrestomathie
arabe</cite>, <abbr title="volume Two pages">vol II. pp.</abbr> 191, 227, and undertook a detailed history of this
sect. The name of the Druses is derived from <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">دروز</span> <dfn>deroz</dfn>, or <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">درزية</span>,
<dfn>derziyet</dfn>, “juncture.” They are the disciples of Hamza, son of Ali, and
honor as a god <dfn>Hakem beamr allah</dfn>, “he who governs by the order of
God;” the sixth Fatimite khalif, in descent from Obaid-allah. Hakem
was born in the year of the Hejira 375, A. D. 985; he was saluted khalif
in 386 (A. D. 996); he disappeared, some say was assassinated, at the end
of 441, A. D. 1020. The Druses give the same dates of his birth, reign,
and death, but say he was the son of Ismâil, a descendant of Ali, the son
of Abu Taleb, and his mother was of the race of Fatima, surnamed
Zahra, the daughter of Muhammed the prophet. In short, every division
of the Ismáilah appears to have its own <dfn>Mahdi</dfn>, “director,” but
always traces his origin to Ali and Fatima. The Druses expect the return
of Hakem; he is to reign over the whole earth during centuries of
centuries, and the unitarian Druses with him: the other sects shall be
obliged to pay homage and tribute to him. The Druses esteem the
Koran very much, but the prophet not at all; they have rejected circumcision,
fasting, and prayer, and indulge in drinking wine, eating
pork, and marrying within the prohibited degrees.</p>

 The character and life of the khalif, mentioned above and in the
preceding note, exhibit a strange mixture of intelligence and folly, superstition
and incredulity, simplicity and ostentation, abstemiousness
and liberality, intolerance and forbearance, cruelty and mildness; all
his good and bad actions were marked with something whimsical and
fantastical: still more&mdash;he wanted to be God: thus he realized in himself
the idea of a monstrous tyrant. To his honor be it said that he
founded in Cairo the first university of the middle ages.&mdash;(See his <cite>Life</cite>,

 An excellent work to be consulted with respect to Hassan, son of

published in Paris, 1812, by Am. Jourdain, with a French translation

 Some people of Hassan’s sect established his genealogy as follows:
“Hassan, son of Ali, son of Jâfer, son of Hassan, son of Muhammed, son
of Sabah Homairi Yemini, but Hassan, to whom it was presented, ordered
it to be cancelled, saying: ‘I prefer being a simple privileged
servant of the Imám to being his degenerated son.’”&mdash;(<cite>Mirkhond</cite>,

 We shall have further to notice Nizam al mulk, and a remarkable
work which he left. From this work, Mirkhond (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 31) quotes the following
words respecting the Imám Movafek, above mentioned: “The
Imám, one of the most illustrious among the learned men of Khorassan,
was generally honored, and his society sought after as a source of happiness.
He was then more than eighty-five years of age, and it was an
opinion generally received, that all young men who instructed themselves
under his direction in the science of the Koran and prophetic
traditions, obtained the favor of fortune.”]</p>

 Mirkhond has <span class="title">Hakim Omar Khayam</span>. Silvestre de Sacy (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 32, note)
thought that it would perhaps be better to translate “Hakim, son of

 Alp Arselan, son of Daud (or David), son of Mikail (Michael), son of
Seljuk was the second sultan of the family and dynasty of the Seljucides.
He succeeded to Togrul Bèg, his uncle, who died without offspring in the
year of the Hejira 455 (A. D. 1063). At first called <span class="title">Isrâil</span>, he took, after
his conversion to Muhammedism, the name of Muhammed with the surname
<dfn>Alp Arselan</dfn>, “the courageous lion” in the Turkish language.
His most memorable victory was that gained with 12,000 men over 300,000
Greeks, whom he put to flight, and took their emperor Romanus, surnamed
Diogenes.</p>

 Moez eddin (according to others <span class="title">Jelal eddin</span>, or <span class="title">Jelal daulet</span>, “the

although not the eldest, was declared by his father to be his successor,
by the counsel of the above mentioned Nizam ul mulk, and mounted the
throne after his father’s death, in the year of the Hejira 465 (A. D. 1072).

 Mirkhond (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 37, French <abbr title="translation">transl.</abbr>) gives a clearer account of the event,
as follows: Nizam-ul-mulk, before the presentation of the register to the
Sultan, having met Hassan’s servant outside the hall, requested of him
to see the register, in order that he might know the manner in which it
was made, and the servant not daring, out of respect to the minister,
refuse it to him, delivered the register into the hands of Nizam-ul-mulk,
who, having seen the nicety of the statements, dropped the leaves in such
a manner as to disperse them, and said: “Many plunders are written
in this register.” The servant, on account of the risk he ran if he
avowed what had happened, said nothing of the fact to Hassan. When
the latter presented his statements, he found them mutilated, and the
leaves confusedly mixed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_633" id="footnote_633"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_633"><span class="muchsmaller">[633]</span></a>
 Nizam-ul-mulk, who in the above related anecdote, does not appear in
an advantageous light, has nevertheless the reputation of having been a
most learned man, and a protector of science. He left a work, called
<dfn>vaśiyet Nizam-ul-mulk</dfn>, “the testament of Nizam-ul-mulk,” from which
Mirkhond relates, partly in the same words as the author, what had passed
between Nizam-ul-mulk and Hassan; the former, of course, endeavors
to vindicate his conduct towards the latter. Nizam-ul-mulk, after having
rendered the most eminent services to his Sultan, was discarded by him
on the suggestions of a Sultana, and assassinated, in the year of the
Hejira 485 (A. D. 1092), according to Herbelot (<cite>art. Malik-schah</cite>), by the
successor to his office; according to our author (see hereafter) by an

 Mirkhond gives a more detailed account of Hassan’s itinerary, as
follows: Hassan went from Isfahan to Yezed, and to Kirman; whence he
returned to Isfahan, where he resided four months; he departed again
for Khozistan, staid there three months, and then went to Damegan,
in which town and district he passed three years. After that he proceeded
to Jorjan, and using every caution for not falling into the
hands of his enemies, he went to Sari, from thence to Damawend,
whence, by the route of Kazwin, he entered Dilem; from thence he
passed into a town near Alamut, where he devoted himself to a religious
life. I have thus enumerated the countries in which the doctrine of
the Ismâilahs was more or less spread, but not without opposition.</p>

adherents, whom he sent about to propagate his religion, and to execute

 Barkíarok, son of Malik shah, was the fourth sultan of the house of
the Seljucides. He received at the circumcision the Muselman name of
Kassem, and the title of <dfn>Rokn-eddin</dfn>, “the column of religion,” was
given to him by Mectadi, the khalif of Baghdad. Barkiarok was the
eldest son of Malik shah, whom he succeeded in the year of the Hejira
485 (A. D. 1092).</p>

<p class="footnote">His stepmother, Turkan Khatun, had a son by Malik shah, called
Mahmúd. At the death of the Sultan, being in the town of Baghdad,
she obtained, by solicitations and presents, from the khalif Mortadi,
letters of investiture in favor of her own son Mahmud, who, then only
four years old, was proclaimed the legitimate heir of his father’s empire,
whilst Barkiarok was at Ispahan, then the seat of the Seljucides, recognised,
by right of primogeniture, the only legitimate successor of his
father. But Turkan Khatun marched to Ispahan with an army, surprised
Barkiarok, and seized the town, and the person of her step-son.
The latter however, aided by the faithful servants of his father, escaped
from her hands, and found a refuge at Shiraz, the residence of <span class="person">Takash-teghin</span>
the <dfn>Atabek</dfn>, or “lieutenant-general” of Persia. With this chief’s
assistance, Barkiarok presented himself with an army of two hundred
thousand men before Ispahan, and besieged Mahmud and his mother.
A peace was concluded: the Sultana and her son were to possess the
town and dependencies of Ispahan, but to divide Malik shah’s treasury
with Barkiarok; he received five hundred thousand gold dinars for his
share, and, having raised the siege, moved to Hamdan, where Ismâil, one
of his uncles, commanded.</p>

<p class="footnote">Ismâil had declared himself for the Sultana: a battle was fought in
the plain of Hamdan, in the year of the Hejira 486 (A. D. 1093); Bakiàrok
gained the victory: his uncle fell.</p>

<p class="footnote">In the very same year, the victor was obliged by another uncle of his,
Takash, son of Aslan shah, to retire towards Ispahan. He was kindly
received by his brother Mahmud, then free from the tutelage of his mother,
who had died; both brothers appeared linked in the bonds of perfect
amity; but the partizans of the younger seized the person of the
elder, and imprisoned him in the castle. It was the sudden death of
Mahmud by the small pox which liberated Barkiarok, and gave him the
possession of the empire. This was not left undisturbed, but this is not
the place to relate the events of his agitated reign, of about thirteen
years, which terminated in the year of the Hejira 498 (A. D. 1104). I
have said enough to show how, among such disturbances, the power of
the Ismâilah could grow in the Persian provinces: to this I shall add
that during the reign of Barkiarok, the European crusaders took Nicæa
and Antiochia, and the cross was fixed upon the walls of Jerusalem,
Akka, and Edessa.</p>

 This peace, according to Mirkhond (<cite>French <abbr title="translation">transl.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48) was made
under three conditions, to which the Ismâlíahs were held:&mdash;1, not to
add any new work to their castles; 2, not to buy arms and warlike stores;
3, not to make new proselytes. The Muhammedan doctors, not having
approved the treaty, the people suspected the Sultan of some hankering

between Sinjar and them, who had even the revenue of some districts
assigned to them, and were in others exempt from paying duties.</p>

<p class="footnote">There is evidently an omission or hiatus at this place in the edition
of Calcutta. According to Mirkhond (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 57-59), after the murder of
Hassan, son of Muhammed, Hassan’s son Muhammed, occupied the
throne. He maintained the doctrine of his father, and had great pretensions
to learning. He governed, from the age of nineteen, forty-six
years with great success; the <span class="title">Molheds</span> (so were called his adherents)
triumphed every where among rapine and bloodshed. He died in the
year of the Hejira 607 (A. D. 1210-1). He was succeeded by his son
Jelal eddin Hassan, ben Muhammed, ben Hassan, who was born in the
year of the Hejira 552 (A. D. 1157-8), therefore fifty-three years old when
he began to reign. Mirkhond says, doubtingly, that according to some
historians, he poisoned his father, which is positively asserted in the
text of the Dabistán. He re-established the Muslim religion, and acquired
the name of Jelal-eddin <dfn>nóu Muselman</dfn>, “new Muselman.”</p>

 Ruk neddin was the eldest son of Alá-eddin; as heir presumptive he
was much honored by the Ismâilahs, who made no difference between his
orders and those of his father. The latter, irritated on that account,
declared a younger son his successor, in spite of the people’s attachment
to the eldest. Rukn-eddin, perpetually threatened by Ala-eddin’s resentment,
took refuge in a well defended castle. He was suspected, and even
accused by his own mother, of having been privy to the murder of his
father, although he punished the murderer.</p>

 Holagú was the grandson of <span class="person">Jengish khan</span>. Born in 1127 A. D.,
Jengish khan, in the first moiety of the thirteenth century, came with six
hundred thousand Tartars from the high lands between China, Siberia,
and the Caspian sea, to act his formidable part in the Southern countries,
already deluged with blood by the unceasing wars of the Arabs,
Persians, and Turks. The dominion of the Seljuk dynasty, torn asunder
by the dissensions of their members, during forty years after Sinjar, their
Sultan, last mentioned in the Dabistán (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 440), terminated with Toghrul
the Third, in 1193 A. D.; there remained still a vigorous branch of it in
Jelál-eddin, sultan of Khorazm, who retired before the great conqueror
towards India; he was overthrown in a great battle on the Indus, in
1222 A. D. Jengishkhan died in 1227, after having made a division of
his immense empire: he gave the kingdoms of Khorassan and Kabul to
his fourth son, Tuli khan, who died soon after his father, leaving four
sons, the two eldest of whom were the above mentioned Maikú kán
(Mangu khán), and Holagú khán. The former ruled in Tartary, the
second proceeded to the conquest of Persia and the empire of the khalifs.
It was necessary first to subdue the Ismâilahs.</p>

<p class="footnote">Rukn-eddin, according to Mirkhond, offered submission to Holagú: it
was by accident that an action took place between the Ismâilahs and the
troops sent by Holagú to take possession of Alamút. Rukn-eddin, after
some delay, during which he had taken his residence in the fort Maimun-diz,
surrendered his person to Holagú, who had come to besiege it. With
Rukn-eddin was the celebrated astronomer Nassir-eddin Túsí, who acted
as ambassador and mediator; but seeing the ruin of the Ismâilahs, not,
as he pretended, in the position of the heavenly bodies, but in the circumstances,
he is accused of betraying his master and delivering him into
the hands of the conqueror. More than forty castles, full of the Molhuds’
treasures, were destroyed in a short time; among the last were
Lamsir and Alamút; the inhabitants of the latter hesitated to surrender,
not being able to separate themselves at once from their accustomed
glory and independence, whilst their sovereign acted as an instrument in
the hands of the conquerors for delivering up his own subjects, having
lost, with his good fortune, all firmness and nobleness of mind.</p>

<p class="footnote">One of the forts only remained: it was <span class="title">Kirdcoh</span>. The feeble Rukn-eddin,
on his way to Mangu khan, could not prevail upon himself to
give it up, and instead of ordering the garrison to surrender, as he had
promised, he sent them word to resist. Proceeding towards Tartary, he
was put to death by the officers of his escort, who probably had received
orders to that effect from Mangú khán. A death-mandate was also executed
upon Rukn-eddin’s sons, daughters, relatives, servants, and other
followers all over the country; thousands of the Ismâilahs fell under the
sword of the Tartars. Holagú completed the conquest of this powerful
sect, which had been formidable in Asia during one hundred and sixty-six
years, in the year of the Hejira 654, A. D. 1256.</p>

<p class="footnote">But the Ismâilahs did not cease to exist in Persia, where, even in our
days, some remains of them are to be found. We read in the Transactions
of the Literary Society of Bombay (<abbr title="volume Two pages">vol. II. pp.</abbr> 281-294), that the
parents of a Muhammed Mahdi, claiming descent from Ali, were inhabitants
of Júnpúr, a town near Benares. He was born in the year of the
Hejira 847 (A. D. 1443), declared himself a Mahdi, in Hejira 903 (A. D.
1491), first in Mecca, and then in Western India, in Guzerat, and Ajmír;
and died in Hejira 910 (A. D. 1504), in Furuh, a city of Khorassan, not
without leaving many followers, communities of whom remain, even in
our days, most numerous in Sind, Guzerat, and the Deccan.</p>

<p class="footnote">Halagú, after the overthrow of the Ismâilahs, marched towards Baghdád,
it is said, at the instigation of Nassir-eddin. The celebrated seat of the
khalifs was taken and destroyed in the year of the Hejira 656 (A. D. 1258),
without the required efforts to defend it having been made by the thirty-seventh
and last khalif of the Abbasides. This inglorious prince, fallen
into the hands of his barbarous enemies, met with a cruel death, being
packed up in a piece of felt, and dragged through the streets of his capital.
With him perished the khalifate, a dominion once the most powerful and
absolute of the world. It began with Abu Bekr in the eleventh year of
the Hejira (A. D. 632), and lasted 645 lunar, or 625 solar years, during
520 of which it remained in the house of the Abbasides. The khalifate of
the Fatimites in Egypt had ceased to exist in the year of the Hejirah 567
(A. D. 1171). All attempts to raise another khalifate in Asia and Africa
had but a short and confined success, or none at all.</p>

 In the seventh <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> of the Asiatic Researches (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 338, <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr> of Calcutta),
we find an article by T. H. Colebrooke, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, <cite>On the Origin and peculiar
Tenets of certain Muhammedan Sects</cite>. It is there stated that: “The
Ali Ilahiyahs are become numerous in India. This sect is mentioned
by the author of the Dabistán, as prevalent in his time only at <span class="place">Uzbil</span>,
or <span class="place">Azbal</span>, in the mountainous tract near <span class="place">Khata</span>. It now prevails,
according to the information which I have received, in a part of the
dominion of Nawab Nizamu ’l mulk.” The Calcutta edition of the
Dabistán reads as above, <span class="place">Arnil</span>, <span class="place">Armál</span>, and <span class="place">Bakhta</span>: the manuscript of
Oude agrees with Colebrooke’s reading, <span class="place">Azbíl</span>, but has <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">بخطا</span>, <span class="place">bakhtá</span>,
and <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">زبال</span>, <span class="place">zebál</span>, for the two other names. The celebrated Orientalist
gives an abstract of the doctrine of this sect according to the Dabistán,
joined to an account of the <span class="title">Borahs</span>, according to the <cite>Mejálîsu ’l múmínin</cite>,
composed by <span class="person">Núrallah of Shoster</span>, a zealous Shiâh. The Bóhrahs
are described by this author as natives of Guzerat, converted to the
Muhammedan religion about three hundred years before his time, now
542 years ago. Their converter was <span class="person">Mullah Ali</span>, whose tomb is still seen
at the city of Combáyat. Some of this tribe are Sunnites. The party
who profess the Imámiah tenets comprehended, in the year 1800, nearly
two thousand families. They are chiefly occupied in trade, and transmit
the fifth part of their gains to the Sayyads of Medina: they are honest,
pious, and temperate.</p>

 We find in the Dictionary <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">دحيه الكلبى</span> <dfn>dihyat ol kalbi</dfn>, interpreted
“the ape-dog; the shape in which the Muhammedans believe the angel
Jabriel to have appeared to their prophet.” This is not mentioned in
the Koran. We read in a note of Sale’s Koran, <abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 401: It is
said that Jabril appeared in his proper shape to none of the prophets
except Muhammed, and to him only twice: once when he received the
first revelation of the Koran, and a second time when he took his night-journey
to heaven. According to the nineteenth chapter of the Koran,
Jabril appeared to the Virgin Mary in the shape of a man, like a full
grown but beardless youth, and caused her to conceive.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_672"><span class="muchsmaller">[672]</span></a>
 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">امي</span> <dfn>ámí</dfn>, “illiterate,” was the epithet which Muhammed was
pleased to give to himself, not without the intention of rendering it so
much more probable that the writing, which he produced as revelations
from God, could not possibly be a forgery of his own; because it was not
conceivable that a person who could neither read nor write should be
able to compose a book of such excellent doctrine, and in so elegant a
style. It was as “the illiterate” that in the 155th verse of the VIIth
chapter of the Koran he causes himself to be announced by God, who is
introduced speaking to Moses about the punishment deserved by the Jews
for their iniquities; and says (ibid., v. 154): “My mercy extendeth over
all things, and I will write down good unto those who shall fear me,
and give alms, and who shall believe our signs&mdash;(v. 155): who shall
follow the apostle, the <em>illiterate prophet</em>, whom they shall find written
down (i. e. both foretold by name and certain description), with
them in the law and the gospel: he will command them that which is
just, and will forbid them that which is evil,” etc., etc. We can, however,
scarcely doubt that Muhammed, belonging to the family of Hashem,
the most illustrious tribe of the Koreish, the hereditary guardians of the
temple of Mecca, and himself skilful in commerce, was not more illiterate
than the Arabs of his class: he certainly proved himself a man of a
lofty genius, and, although he wrote not in verse, a sublime poet.</p>

 We read above the account of sectaries who deified Alí. So much
is certain, that, from his most tender youth, he was the most zealous,
courageous, and intelligent supporter of Muhammed. The prophet gave
him the surname of “the lion of God:” he said to him: “Thou art my
vizir, and my brother in this and the other world. Thou standest
by me as Aaron stood by Moses; except that no prophet will come
after me, I have no advantage over thee. I am the town of knowledge,
and Alí the gate to it.” Alí was a poet; we have but half a dozen of
his poems and one hundred of his sayings.&mdash;(See the above-quoted

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
